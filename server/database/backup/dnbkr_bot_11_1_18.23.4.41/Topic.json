I'm definitely excited to check it out though. \n\nWhile I have you I know it's not ideal to hold on exchanges for long but I'm pretty confused about holding multiple different coins. I've heard stuff about different wallets and stuff and I'm rather lost.

Every couple of weeks they announce another massive company they have partnered with which pushes the price up.\n\nThere is a blockchain conference in Australia soon.

Some safe coins to look into for a beginner are ICX, VEN, XLM, ENG, REQ.  XLM is actually overdue to go up and is at a really good price right now.  Do your own research first, though.  Try and buy them when their prices dip a little.  Make sure you do research on coins before you buy, so you don't end up with bullshit like TRX.  It's basically a scam coin.\n\nAlso, as for the price of a coin, you need to look at the market cap as well.  The price doesn't matter.  TRON is $.10, but it has one of the highest market caps out of all of the coins because there are 65 billion of them circulating.  This isn't a bad thing for a coin to have a lot of circulating coins, but it is the reason some of the bigger coins look cheap.  Check out https://coinmarketcap.com",

There is a lot of account registering, password creation, and 2FA enabling, but security is important. Make sure you dont use the same passwords for exhanges wallets or your email obviously. I leave a good bit in my exchange wallet, but that is much less secure then sending it off exchange. You may have to pay fees to pull some coins out of exchanges, and wallets generally have minimum storage fees. Binance, an exchange, offers a lot of coins you listed (XLM,TRX,DOGE) and many more, its my favorite exchange. That and Kucoin (another exchange) will have your head spinning on options. Kucoin you can get XRB, its one of my most excited for coins, and ITS ON SALE with the market dip. Eth is pretty much a universal transfer currency on most exchanges but also could be worth holding a good bit if you are less risk averse. Lots of other coins are essentially just eth at the end of the day.",

ADA is another great example... wonderful product, totally NOT vapourware, but should it really be valued greater than spacex? Really? I had some ADA, but jumped ship at .60. Did I jump too early? In hindsight, absolutely. But how could I know it would get bloated that high. It rose above where I was comfortable holding it, based on the actual products they have released (i.e. zero).\n\nWe're going up against hoards of mindless fools, so how can we lose longterm?",

VEN won't correct as hard because people will find a home in the VEN community and will hold unlike TRX where half of the money was people looking to ride the pump.",

Do you think I will have an opportunity to sell them at a higher price? any possible pumps?

Personally, if it were you, what else would you get rid of? (Don't worry, I just like comparing peoples opinion, and I take everything people say on here with a grain of salt.)

Once PRL has a full working product, I could see it being implemented very quickly, and adoption rate would likely be higher than BAT or other similar projects.  Given that ANT has twice the market cap of PRL, I think from an investment standpoint, percentage wise PRL will out grow ANT easily.",

Ripple could be a project that sort of leaves the cryptocurrency sphere and becomes something as integral to banking as a telephone and Microsoft Excel, and for that it can be worth a massive amount in market cap.  It is not my favorite project by any means but the use case is pretty undeniable.  It is hard to describe but I feel no FOMO watching it go up while I want to stay in bed all day when I see things like PRL gain the same amount.",

        "comment": "I got started on Coinbase and only invested a little here and there in the big 3, and what may have been the most valuable lesson was that I bough in about two days before the big China crackdown.  I was in the red for all 3 (BTC/LTC/ETH) for over a month, and I was ready to kill my friends who got me interested in crypto.  But then I saw the coins climbing back and for whatever reason, I bought more.  It was not until early November that I made a Binance account and I got into Iota (based on a conversation I had with a guy at the gym sitting in the sauna lol).  I bought some Monero and Dash and that really opened my eyes.\n\nFast forward a bit and I dumped my dash, and I am now really high on REQ, IOTA, XRB, and NEO as solid projects with pretty bright futures, but by far I am most excited for VEN.  VEN looks just fantastic and is my largest holding right now.  I have also gotten my toes wet with some super small cap coins like WABI and WTC, and I might pick up some PRL.\n\nI am no expert and the market has treated me well, but I would say that a good mix of positions is a smart play.  Small market cap coins have the highest upside.  BTC is at ~300 billion market cap, so for it to double again would represent another 300 billion dollars being represented by BTC.  With smaller coins like WABI, we are only talking about another 500 million being represented for it to go 3.5x its current price.  Those are where to make your money and shotgunning small coins and hoping some will take off is a good way to catch massive gainers.\n\nIf you put $100 into ten small coins and 2 completely crash, 7 stay totally stagnant, and one goes 20x, you will be significantly up from where you started, and that is a very conservative estimation looking at where even big coins were a year ago.\n\nHappy hunting!",

I hope I'm wrong about the dev team and be eating crow after the testnets.\n\nYou reducing this very interesting (in concept) project to \"POTENTIAL mining script BLOCKCHAIN\" is just lazy and ignorant. If you don't know anything about it, please keep your meme opinions to yourself.",

Ublock blocks it for this reason. Do you think no one had the idea to ask permission to run the script?\n\nEven when running without the user's permission, it's extremely inefficient to run on the majority of your users' devices (mobile). And the sites which might consider running PRL, such as pron sites, will still continue to run ads to increase revenue. Then not only will PRL have to fight the already sketchy mining scripts, but also its own adopters. It's got everything going against it.",

What I think will be the first area to see adoption will be mobile apps utilizing PRL's underlying code in their apps instead of ads. This would allow users to download and use apps and games for free and without adds, with the tradeoff of allowing PRL to use a small portion of their phone's computing power, which would be far more preferable than closing ads ever 2-3 minutes. I'm really hyped for this project though and looking forward to seeing what they do over the next few months!",

Not shilling you or anything we must all do our due diligence.\n\nNo predictions at price, just saying that FUN's goal is not decentralization or whatever.  They just want to establish a cryptocurrency that casinos will use as a platform.  \n\nThere is news coming out from the FUN project team in February.  Like they say buy the rumor sell the news. I'll let you decide which one you want to do.\n\nI'm holding this coin because I think the business plan is realistic and not full of \"wishy washy ideals\" like decentralize, privacy, or whatnot just straight business.  FUN project team wants their cryptocurrency to become a usable platform for online gambling.\n\nAlso, I actually looked at their website to make sure that decentralize is not in their website.  And I did a CTRL F (find) and did not see it, now I know why it's stuck in my head that their coin is not about decentralization.  ",

VEN has performed so well this week it now holds a commanding position in my alt portfolio. I don't have a problem with this.\n\nMy XLM majority was bought at $0.02 so despite the drop after I bought more at $0.65 I'm still positive on it. I don't want to remove this.\n\nI'm considering dropping my IOTA & XMR considering I have a large chunk of my portfolio in the safe two already. WTC & BNTY are two coins I'm keen to acquire, but I'm considering Elixir (wary) or bringing my ENG/LEND duo up to 7.5%.\n\nThe WABI is just my shitcoin gambling fund.\n\n",

        "comment": "I love FUN and PBL.\n\nOnline gambling industry is huge. Lots of suspicion from players and would-be players about the fairness of the online casino platforms currently existing. Licensing the FUN platform and utilizing FUN tokens seems like a great way to not only make money, but to ensure that the online casino games are 100% fair and legitimate. I think this one could be huge. Might set the standard within a few years in that particular industry.\n\nWith PBL, I'm bullish on that one too, but there are a few things I'd like to see happen. The #1 thing it needs, is established authors with sizable fan bases to announce their support and commitment to the Publica platform for the release of their next book, or future books. The #1 issue facing Publica is the establishment of the current system. People go to Amazon when they want to buy books, period. That model obviously sucks financially for authors, but no one will use Publica if readers are not visiting the site. But established authors with established fan bases can use Publica -- those fans will do what they have to do to purchase the book. And now you see how Publica can develop a following. The recruitment of big-name authors is critical.",

        "comment": "This is my approach. I am going for a platform/passive income approach. My main holdings are NEO, ARK, ETH and VEN. These are the platforms which I believe the future of most crypto currencies will be built upon. Look at the top 100 coins, most are ERC tokens. These also (2 out of 4) currently generate passive income for doing nothing more than simply holding the coin. VEN will soon be generating THOR by EOQ2, and I see things around about ETH going to POS which I presume might generate a bit of passive income also. \n\nI highly believe in these platforms for the long term and am speculating that the prices will increase enough for my positions to be able to give me enough income to quit my job and go do my own thing. The total portfolio value by that time would need to be big, but I think 1 year out there is a lot to gain using this strategy and in the following years there will be more (albeit, perhaps less substantial gains) gains to be had along with the passive income. \n\nGoing back to ERC20 tokens being a majority of the top 100 coins, this is evidence to me that there is so much at stake for Ethereum that will will not simply disappear. This is a very unlikely scenario IMO. Prices might level off, but with the ecosystems these platforms are building they will not be disappearing anytime soon. ",

        "comment": "If ETH is their competitor, so is Cardano, NEM, LISK, ARK and tons of other blockchains that can do dApps. \n\nVEN is cool, but it's not that unique. Their Proof of Authority is very similar to NEO. Their RFID approach is very similar to MOD and WTC. Their dApps promises are very similar to NEO, ETH, LISK and ADA. NEO is basically telling everyone what they want to hear, using the the most exciting words and concepts to draw people in. It might work, but that's all it is. \n\n>You can read this objective analysis why VEN is undervalued.\n\nI've read that analysis. It's very good. It also assumes that VEN creates tremendous demand for the THOR token. Nobody knows right now if that's true, or how much money is going to spent on THOR in Y1, Y2, or Y3.\n\nI'll tell you, it's highly unlikey the supply chain industry spends over a billion dollars on a new and untested technology in Y1. I've been a regulator my whole life. Nobody in any industry swaps out infrastructure like that without beta testing and scaling integration. \n\nThe ironic part of VEN, is that speculators attempting to ride a wave of profits might severely overvalue a solid technological use for a cryptocurrency., Tokens like VEN are so clear on what you get and how it works, that overvaluation is easier to spot. \n\nVEN may go to $40 a token. Great for holders. Say you hold 1000 VEN. That's $40,000. It's also 150 THOR. What if you get $1 per THOR on the market. THat's $150 a year for a $40,000 investment. AKA dog shit. The price will tank. That COULD happen. \n\nBeware of speculators. If anyone kills VEN, it'll be them.",

        "comment": "[Disclaimer: I hodl both] think VEN can coexist with NEO if it sticks to its guns: RFID supply chain tracking.\n\nRecent news about VEN  has me worried for them. They try to move into the ICO/dApp/smart contract area. In this area NEO is simply put lightyears ahead. Don't trust blindly in the relentless VEN shilling we've seen here lately. There's always a \"coin of the month\" and right now it's VEN. It'll pass and it remains to be seen whether VEN will actually be here to stay.\n\nI also don't like that VEN is stealing NEO's roadmap to try to achieve their goals. It looks as though this is done because in the end it really pushed the value of NEO. I'm referring to:\n\n- VEN is going to rebrand... just like NEO did.\n- VEN is moving to a governance token / utility token structure... exactly like the one NEO has innovatively created.\n- VEN is suddenly aiming to be a smart contract / ICO / dApp platform... just like NEO.\n\nMake no mistake, NEO has the advantage in terms of name and fame, in terms of tech it is incomparably ahead (correct me if I'm wrong, but VEN doesn't even seem to have a main net yet). In terms of full time DEV communities  (CoZ and NEL are huge), working dApps and smoothly launched ICOs (+30 planned), of which 3 have already moved into CMC in their own right. VEN has none of this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, VEN has potential, but we shouldnt pretend it will be able to compete with NEO on its home turf and certainly not abroad. ",

Some safe coins to look into for a beginner are ICX, VEN, XLM, ENG, REQ.  XLM is actually overdue to go up and is at a really good price right now.  Do your own research first, though.  Try and buy them when their prices dip a little.  Make sure you do research on coins before you buy, so you don't end up with bullshit like TRX.  It's basically a scam coin.\n\nAlso, as for the price of a coin, you need to look at the market cap as well.  The price doesn't matter.  TRON is $.10, but it has one of the highest market caps out of all of the coins because there are 65 billion of them circulating.  This isn't a bad thing for a coin to have a lot of circulating coins, but it is the reason some of the bigger coins look cheap.  Check out https://coinmarketcap.com",

I've worked as a consultant and one of the biggest issues clients face isn't the solution we come up with, it's actually applying it.\n\nI feel like its still very possible that VEN wouldn't be able to get enough users in every part of the cycle - which would cause it to be incomplete and possibly fall apart.\n\n... This is only a theory tho. I'm not confident enough to end this without saying \"idk tho\"",

        "comment": "I think VEN has good partnerships for the things they should be focussed on: supply chain tracking purposes. For that purpose it will serve them really well. Also, I feel that partnerships of VEN are extremely hyped up. NEO for example has hosted a DEV competition with Microsoft China and is even now hosting one with Microsoft, the results of which will be presented in Silicon Valley (so not Microsoft China. No: Microsoft). NEO doesn't tout that relationship though. Also, there are multiple meetings on a weekly basis where NEO council staffers or CoZ members travel around the world to give workshops and presentations. There was one in Dublin some days ago. Today they are in Hamburg. I'm attending one tomorrow in Amsterdam where NEO will teach us a masterclass on how to write simple smart contracts in the VM. 5 soon to launch ICOs will attend as well, among which a decentralized exchange that will run on the NEO blockchain. VEN is nowhere near that level of maturity. Also, NEO is known far and wide now as the new go-to regulation compliant blockchain solution. Did you catch the interview that Da Hongfei gave on Bloomberg this morning? He explains it perfectly.\n\nAnyways, all that stuff is secondary. Like Da Hongfei always says: \"focus on the tech\". ",

Not expecting a lambo out of this but maybe enough to pay off school debt someday.\n\nIs it better to go all in on 3 coins you really really believe in (Say a 60/20/20 split) or to diversify into 10 coins you think have potential but smaller amounts 10% each? \n\nI have mixed feelings. On the one hand I feel like the solid coins I believe in such as VEN are a much better investment, but seeing some posts about how people threw just $100 at top10 without research and came out with almost $30k has me thinking this is in part a game of luck.",

        "comment": "I have gone all in on Ven. \n\n1) Who knows\n\n2) No\n\n3) Here's the thing. What's the point of diversification? It's to reduce risk. But if you wanted reduced risk, you'd put all your money in fiat, or stocks or something like that. The risk would be significantly lower. \n\nIt's cliche, but I'm in crypto for that elusive \"lambo\". That's why I'm going all in; it's in the spirit of high risk high reward that crypto is today. I don't know if ven will succeed or not. It is certainly high risk. However, at this point, I feel like it's the only chance for me to have a realistic chance of making a life changing amount. And if that means the risk is I lose everything, so be it.\n\nIn terms of waiting for other coins to \"go back to a normal level\", that's just wishful thinking. There's no such thing as a \"normal level\". You'll get stung if you get too greedy. What if they continue to drop while VEN continues to go up? Then you'll think \"I could have gotten 50% more ven earlier, so I'm going to wait a bit more\" and then eventually, you just end up missing out completely.\n\nMake a decision, and then follow through with it. And don't regret it no matter what ends up happening. ",

        "comment": "I got started on Coinbase and only invested a little here and there in the big 3, and what may have been the most valuable lesson was that I bough in about two days before the big China crackdown.  I was in the red for all 3 (BTC/LTC/ETH) for over a month, and I was ready to kill my friends who got me interested in crypto.  But then I saw the coins climbing back and for whatever reason, I bought more.  It was not until early November that I made a Binance account and I got into Iota (based on a conversation I had with a guy at the gym sitting in the sauna lol).  I bought some Monero and Dash and that really opened my eyes.\n\nFast forward a bit and I dumped my dash, and I am now really high on REQ, IOTA, XRB, and NEO as solid projects with pretty bright futures, but by far I am most excited for VEN.  VEN looks just fantastic and is my largest holding right now.  I have also gotten my toes wet with some super small cap coins like WABI and WTC, and I might pick up some PRL.\n\nI am no expert and the market has treated me well, but I would say that a good mix of positions is a smart play.  Small market cap coins have the highest upside.  BTC is at ~300 billion market cap, so for it to double again would represent another 300 billion dollars being represented by BTC.  With smaller coins like WABI, we are only talking about another 500 million being represented for it to go 3.5x its current price.  Those are where to make your money and shotgunning small coins and hoping some will take off is a good way to catch massive gainers.\n\nIf you put $100 into ten small coins and 2 completely crash, 7 stay totally stagnant, and one goes 20x, you will be significantly up from where you started, and that is a very conservative estimation looking at where even big coins were a year ago.\n\nHappy hunting!",

I made 3x profit on VEN, sold at ATH and I bought NEO in a dip. I also held a couple NEO before, sold them at $50 and regretted it. I'm starting to feel like I want to shift my investments to viable platforms like NEO, ETH and ICX. We'll see how VEN can continue to grow (I still held 25% of my investment in), but I'm just happy that I got what I wanted. I think I'm going to accumulate my Ledger holdings with NEO for awhile.",

Just like with Ethereum smart contracts needing gas via the form of Ether, and almost every other coin using a transaction fee, this keeps it in the blockchain.

It’s my smallest hold right now but also that is partially because it has not grown as fast as the others have. I like ark but they if they step up their PR/shill game it could really take off. Not complaining since they seem mature and have goals and it is gaining, but it is really subdued. Vertcoin is one that just seems to be falling through the cracks lately not because of the product itself but just not being able to compete with the branding of bitcoin. I’m thinking of picking some up but honestly it probably won’t perform like VEN will so I’m not too broken up about it.\n\nI’ve been looking at OST do you think it looks like a solid project?",

Then that Thor is again sold to power more transactions 30% of which comes back to the node again, and again, and again.  This 30% take gets bigger every week or month or however often Thor is awarded, making it the equivalent of compound interest, that only the thrudheim nodes benefit from.\n\nTell me, what happens to a closed system when only one small portion of the population gets compound interest while the others do not?

Never mind that competitors in your field will have a few years head start on you. There a some major problems outside of this as well.\n\n1)Your block chain will be centralized meaning entries can be changed. \n\n2)Good luck on getting your customers and vendors to hop on board of your proprietary tech. Meaning you wont have supply chain visibility making it not much better than already existing ERP systems.\n\n3) What happens if someone else poaches your developers?\n\nIn the end wouldn't turn key solutions be the better option?\n\nMy main concern like yours is the cost of Thor. The Thor generation rate is fixed until 2020. I understand the issue of integrating tech such as decentralized block chain into a business as the market is flush with speculation right now. The Thor you bought for $1 today could cost $50 a year from now. It takes a lot of effort to put these systems into place and you are going to want to make sure that these systems are not cost prohibitive in the future. This isn't a problem unique to VeChain. \n\nSome ways which VEN is looking to mitigate this is by Thor futures contracts. Perhaps in 2020 they will increase the Thor generation rate. I'm sure they will find a way to make it work, everything else about VEN has been meticulously planned out, I dont think they would have neglected this issue, mainly because it is the biggest issue.",

        "comment": "This is my approach. I am going for a platform/passive income approach. My main holdings are NEO, ARK, ETH and VEN. These are the platforms which I believe the future of most crypto currencies will be built upon. Look at the top 100 coins, most are ERC tokens. These also (2 out of 4) currently generate passive income for doing nothing more than simply holding the coin. VEN will soon be generating THOR by EOQ2, and I see things around about ETH going to POS which I presume might generate a bit of passive income also. \n\nI highly believe in these platforms for the long term and am speculating that the prices will increase enough for my positions to be able to give me enough income to quit my job and go do my own thing. The total portfolio value by that time would need to be big, but I think 1 year out there is a lot to gain using this strategy and in the following years there will be more (albeit, perhaps less substantial gains) gains to be had along with the passive income. \n\nGoing back to ERC20 tokens being a majority of the top 100 coins, this is evidence to me that there is so much at stake for Ethereum that will will not simply disappear. This is a very unlikely scenario IMO. Prices might level off, but with the ecosystems these platforms are building they will not be disappearing anytime soon. ",

Tying media to the blockchain to allow royalities and ownership sounds great unless know anything about cryptography and specifically hashing.\n\nYou have your high resolution scan of the Mona Lisa on the blockchain for royalties. One person takes that image and changes the color of one pixel by one millionth of a shade, suddenly your image is off-chain and infinitely reproducible. The same things can be said for Video, Audio, etc.\n\nYou MIGHT be able to use it for business level royalty work where copyright infringement is more enforceable, but you can already do that now with a Google Image search. Frankly, this is the only way that you'd find violators with the blockchain as well.\n\nThe use case is questionable, EVEN IF IT WAS REAL.

So strictly for speed and the network is why they use XLM. So someone buys REQ using VEN. Behind the screens it will change it will do VEN -> XLM -> REQ. Hopefully everyone eventually knowing this will increase price, but I don't think this behind the screens action effects the XLM price at all. Just proves that XLM can be used for any and all crypto alt coin exchanges which is huge if it works. ",

This prevents you from wishing you would’ve waited cause of a dip, but also makes it so you get in early without missing a rise, even if it’s not as much as you would’ve put in, it’s pretty much the best of both worlds.\n\nOr you can just ignore cost averaging and just buy in one shot and might get lucky and have it moon soon after with a full investment, but I️ wouldn’t plan for such a risky thing with crypto ",

So I bought into VEN a few weeks ago at around $1.50 and sold out at about $4.50 as I listened to a bunch of FUD on long term profitability even with a few strong partnerships. I decided that something with a clear use case and a smaller marketcap like ethlend might yield more returns, and thought what they offered was better than SALT, but then with the good news about VEN continuing to roll in, plus its robustness in the korean dip, that I might've written it off too early. My plan is to basically hold about 1/4 in ETH, 1/8 in BTC, and the rest spread between 3 medium caps and 5 smallcaps that could explode or die. I figured IOTA, ICX, XRB would be good mediums and better to try a couple like ENJ/LEND, but I've changed my thinking on how far VEN can go (I originally thought a marketcap of $3bn would be pushing it for what it offered).",

I just signed up with coinbase and I can afford to buy 200 dollars worth of ETH. 200 is better than 0 in my opinion. \n\nSo. When I have bought the ETH can I then sign up with binance when they are allowing it and buy VEN or ICX?? Also if you would like to give advice on either one it would be appreciated. And if there are any people from the future, please tell me which one hits the moon. I can buy you a happy meal today or wait and let me buy you 3 after this all takes off. \n\nThanks!",

Their Proof of Authority is very similar to NEO. Their RFID approach is very similar to MOD and WTC. Their dApps promises are very similar to NEO, ETH, LISK and ADA. NEO is basically telling everyone what they want to hear, using the the most exciting words and concepts to draw people in. It might work, but that's all it is. \n\n>You can read this objective analysis why VEN is undervalued.\n\nI've read that analysis. It's very good. It also assumes that VEN creates tremendous demand for the THOR token. Nobody knows right now if that's true, or how much money is going to spent on THOR in Y1, Y2, or Y3.\n\nI'll tell you, it's highly unlikey the supply chain industry spends over a billion dollars on a new and untested technology in Y1. I've been a regulator my whole life. Nobody in any industry swaps out infrastructure like that without beta testing and scaling integration. \n\nThe ironic part of VEN, is that speculators attempting to ride a wave of profits might severely overvalue a solid technological use for a cryptocurrency., Tokens like VEN are so clear on what you get and how it works, that overvaluation is easier to spot. \n\nVEN may go to $40 a token. Great for holders. Say you hold 1000 VEN. That's $40,000. It's also 150 THOR. What if you get $1 per THOR on the market. THat's $150 a year for a $40,000 investment. AKA dog shit. The price will tank. That COULD happen. \n\nBeware of speculators. If anyone kills VEN, it'll be them.",

        "comment": "I think you have a point, a working product is a necessity and most projects don't have one. \n\nHowever, I believe that business partnerships are also a strong indicator of future success. The reason people are so high on Vechain is because they have legitimate partnerships with very large companies - PWC, DNV GL, Renault etc) and are backed by Breyer Capital (Facebook, Marvel, Ethereum, etc). These entities likely have far more insight into Vechain's capabilities  than we do, and their approval means a lot more than ours. They do have a working blockchain product, used on wine tracking for now and I believe they are launching their main net Q2. I think their future success is dependent on successfully launching a technically sufficient main net.\n\nI've been following Icon as well, and I think it is a good project. Backing by the Dayli group gives them a huge advantage with networking and resources. Icon is launching their main net this month, much earlier than their competitors which is another huge advantage. I think Icon will do well, but I believe sustained growth (or mooning) is dependent on them fostering more large business connections and ICOs. \n\nThis comment kind of turned into me rambling about my thoughts on both projects, but I guess my point is that getting a product out the door first isn't the only factor to consider. I think for business facing projects like ICX and VEN, having BOTH a technically strong product and business partnerships is the only way they will be successful. ",

If I'm purchasing Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin simply to get it to an exchange to purchase more VEN, I really don't see why I need to be looking at the price of BTC/ETH compared to my VEN even though they are trading pairs. The price of BTC/ETH may go up or down depending on how long it takes to get to the exchange, but other than that I don't really care; I'm holding the base pair for less than an hour. If my goal was to accumulate more BTC, I definitely get it - but that's not what I'm doing. This could be a terrible way of looking at it, but in 2017 all my bills are paid in fiat.

        "comment": "1st Post here... got into crypto a week or so before Christmas having having learnt the ropes buying and transferring bitcoin for the purposes of a couple of (ahem) \"exotic\" purchases. Like anyone else with at least half a brain who has stuck their toes in the water it's been outrageously rewarding and addictive. Even with huge gains the missus getting the hump big time.\n\nShilling on Reddit, youtube etc. has been my main source of info and done me very well. Doupled my initial investment in Ripple. Got in on Tron at 0.4 and sold at 0.15, in on XRB at $10 now have VEN, ICX, NUL and XRB.\n\nHad a few positions in new coin to Kucoin that had been hyped here and by some top Youtubers. Advise by them is always do your own research and make your on decision so I started reading white papers and checking sites. \n\nThe ones I have invested in all seem to check out great although my technical understanding has a long way to go but you can see the partnerships check out as do the backgrounds of the team. They seem legit and, able and passionate about creating some world changing tech.\n\nHowever some of the smaller ones I checked out that had been heavily shilled and recommended by prominent youtubers were a disgrace. Not even than small... pushing the top 50. All looks good until I checked out the credentials of the teams. Checking the Linkedin profiles of the team members is the biggest giveaway for me. \n\nNone of them had any serious credentials. The majority had previous junior positions in second rates web design firms, I saw quite a few  had  2nd rate wordpress sites they had made for in their portfolios and now they are leading the dev team in a company with a $200 million market cap... WTF!! Vapourware or what.\n\nI'm not mentioning names because I'm not here to cause FUD. I know that the majority of coins are scams but these two in particular come highly recommended by Datadash and Altcoin Buzz. I'm guessing either theyr'e stupid and lazy or getting paid. Both coins x3 within days of broadcat.\n\nFair enough I guess as we all know it's the wild West and the lack of regulation is what's making this possible. However I did also watch a Datadash youtube a while ago which was 20 minutes of him apologising for mistakenly taken payments from two coins he had shilled (obviously got sloppy and busted). Can't remember the first one but he was paid 6 Eth which he donated to charity. and will never ever do it again.\n\nThis is brilliant though... Substratum gave him 200,000 coins for shilling them and he admitted it!!! However it turns out he made a rooky error transferring something to a hardrive and mislaid the coins LMFAO. Like he's such a beginner with computers and stuff. Don't \nworry though because if he ever manages to retrieve the coins he'll donate  them too.\n\nOther than that I think he's a thoroughly agreeable chap and have learned a lot of strategies and technical stuff from him.

They don't charge fees to transfer your coins off of GDAX.\n\nYou need to send coins from GDAX to binance. I recommend using Litecoin right now because ETH network has so much going on.\n\nYou will have to replenish your coinbase coins with more USD. You can do that immediately using a debit card as well.",

The general public didn't decide to panic sell alts into BTC / ETH / LTC because that would have supported those coins during the fall... unless all of the Coinbase hobbyists all managed to sell more than the alt-trading Binance users were buying? Which doesn't make sense, because they're less likely to have stop limits / price alerts / be checking their portfolio all day everyday / be checking crypto news all day every day.\n\nWhat the fuck just happened?",

Use ETH, and one XRB can be purchased with fiat then switch to that since there's no tx fees and it's (so far) been fast transfers.\n\nIndicators of when to trade? \n* Best case scenario is wait for ETH to dip, buy it, then wait for ETH to be in the green to buy your alt. \n* Flash crashes make this very easy and convenient\n* If your alt is in a dip and your ETH is in the green, that's another good scenario. *Try to avoid* trading a sinking coin you support for something that is on the rise! There are exceptions, but 9/10 times you want to do the opposite unless there's indisputable proof that your sinking coin will continue to sink\n* Turn your mind off if your portfolio crashes. Take a walk. Enjoy the fresh air. Put on \"This American Life\" or your favourite podcast. Just don't sweat it and look at the coinmarketcap Market Capitalization graph over the past year to put you at ease :)",

        "comment": "> The fact that you can use Python/C#/Java to write its ledger programs shows that the project has no focus on being decentralized.\n\nNEO is a proof-of-stake platform and the node operators are the businesses on that platform. These are the companies that are currently hemorrhaging money into expensive .NET/Oracle/etc. platforms that offer nothing as decentralized as NEO (given that it isn't really decentralized but controlled by those nodes with the most NEO).\n\nImagine *owning* a chunk of your cloud platform provider. Not to mention the decreased costs of using the NEO network to execute your contracts.\n\nThe future of enterprise is shared cloud computing: something like NEO/ETH/Smart Contract platform and then a compute/container service as well as file storage and private networking and you pretty much replaced the top cloud solutions like AWS/Azure/Google. First we need reliable open source hardware so we can prevent shit like Intel's Management Engine. After that we can actually trust hardware on the networks.",

Then if something grabs my attention I'll challenge myself to see how fast I can feel it out through quick research (wallets,miners,pools,algos,dashboard) \nAnd slap up a nice orderly set of those based off whatever templates I'm using... Just to see if I can get in on that...just as practice fort learning all the ins and outs...(will be automating all that with Miner Control soon)...\n\nBut\n\nI get it rocking NICELY... My hardware actually busting the highest hashrates if ever seen those algos go before... On that HAL coin (Halcyon)...\nSit back, go out for a smoke...\nCome back and the dashboard actually said (I digress this happened before the decefeit watching)...\nMy dashboard was displaying that I was mining \"HBC\" coin... \nWtf? Supposed to be HAL...\n\nthis is one of those sites that (after reading the FINE PRINT).. Have a little disclaimer that if you don't include your password as -p c=HAL (HAL or BTC or ETH) etc... Then they don't reject your hashes they just keep that going on... And in tiny print tell you it's your fault...\n(Which it is) \n\nBecause that's a common practice of designating coin in pool algos running...no doubt...\n\nBut for those that hadn't seen that designation specification, ...ooo free hashpowaa for site owners for sure...\n\nAlso any unclaimed unpayed shares for 60 days are \"purged\"... (Code for \"theirs\")...\n\n...so that warning that I posted before, now reads...\n\n\"We are short of this currency (241.39375886 HAL). Please STOP your miners and switch to BTC until we find more HAL blocks.\nYOU are responsible if you continue to mine for HAL despite this warning.\"\n\nLol... So no doubt people saw that $48 profit on the top of whattomine, set up their miners, set their currency password, then left their miners humming and left the house... \nThen conveniently they get the message when AFK or checking dashboard remotely... And can't turn it off...\n\nSo you can imagine the giant sucking sound that has echoed through that site since then...\n\n\n....or maybe it's just a conventional issue and I don't know what the eff in talking about....\n\nTheir Coins' home site needs a redo.\nCool name and symbol.\nWallet wouldn't sync...\nStinky.",

        "comment": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust so everyone does not think this is a scam - here is my 4 ETH refunded back to me by TraDove.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IQUQu\n\nI have reinvested this back into TraDove now as they have given me the confidence this is not a scam...\n\nI came to this conclusion by thinking what are the green flags and what are the red flags?\n\nThe only red flag to most people is the fact that there was one 4chan member stating this was a scam due to the fact the ICO funds were immediately being moved to hundreds of different wallets.\n\nThe reason is fairly simple - the ICO funds (as confirmed when emailing Kent) have been moved onto CoinBase after they hit the TraDove accounts. Doing this is much more secure than storing the funds of an ICO in a single wallet. CoinBase spreads large amounts of funds into multiple wallets - however this is done in the backend of CoinBase - it is a blockchain security feature to spread risk, so if one wallet is compromised, the loss is minimal. Remember when Bittrex was hacked? This is because Bittrex did not do this - they had far too many funds stored in a single wallet point containing millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. So, this is why you are seeing funds moved from the TraDove ICO wallets into CoinBase and then CoinBase moving them in the backend into Binance wallets.\n\nThe only other red flag I can see raised by people is the poor grammatical skills on parts of the ICO website - please remember that the CEO of TraDove is Chinese and sometimes there may be slight spelling errors due to English being a second language - hardly a red flag in my view but I can see how others may interpret that.\n\nNow if anyone has any other issues they would like to bring up I am more than happy to try and get answers for you or even answer them myself.\n\nFinally, I am not in any way affiliated with TraDove, but I went through the entire range of emotions by investing, asking for a refund when I panicked and now am 100% back on board.\n\nThanks everyone :)",

And BCH is decentralized I dont see roger and jihan having access to everyones private key jesus I would say the majority of BCH supporters hate both of them aswell their not our gods.",

The amount of pain watching it soar all while me knowing how advanced the tech was was unbearable. Usually I'll see an alt rise from $0.30 to even $0.50 and I'll pass on it since I didn't get in early enough, but with XRB I created a kucoin account and bought in at $25 and am looking to continue to increase my stake because it really blows every other crypto out of the water.",

        "comment": "It's fucking ridiculous because when I trade stocks I have very clear records of exactly how much USD everything was bought and sold for. With crypto when I'm trading alt to alt and neither can be exchanged directly for USD, exactly how much were they worth at the time of the trade? The exchange doesn't keep detailed records of this. Am I to assume they are worth the USD value of BTC? What if ETH overtakes BTC in marketcap or volume, do I switch over to tracking my prices in that? Do I track the value of USD / BTC on that exchange if they have a pair for it, or do I use the overall market average at that point in time? Meanwhile if I place a limit order and it sells overnight how am I supposed to know what the USD value was at the time the trade was executed? Crypto is super volatile and coinmarketcap only keeps records in hourly increments; that could be 10% difference or more sometimes and as the exchange doesn't keep track of the USD value at sale except for USD pairs I have no records for this. I mean I'm trying to do my best to navigate this regulatory minefield but it's a fucking nightmare. The taxcode really is not cut out for this shit. \n\nThe entire you need to pay taxes as you go on gains but can only claim losses against future capital gains is just a fucked up system, and I mean this for all commodities. So say I hold 1 billion dollars in crypto holdings and the market collapses, that does me a lot of good after I've paid hundreds of million dollars in taxes I don't get back. But oh wait, I can deduct $3000 in income from my next years tax return, fucking lol. The government can go fuck themselves; I fucking hate this country. ",

Even if I convert to Dollar, there also isn't USD/VIVO.\n\nTheoretically I could create an artificial transaction buying VIVO with ETH or BTC, but then I have to go through an extra step, a long process of price conversion among three coins which is way too troublesome and must be done outside the app.\n\nI think it's easy to see how this is a very inefficient way to go about entering transactions.",

I'm unfamiliar with your WA state laws, but typically to purchase XRP or any other alt coin (alt-coin being defined as any coin not BTC or ETH or LTC), you purchase BTC or ETH on a \"cash-to-crypto\" site like Coinbase or Gemini. In your case you purchased BTC on Coinbase. We specifically purchase BTC or ETH because on exchanges that carry a lot of alt-coins, they are typically paired with BTC or ETH meaning we trade BTC or ETH for the alt coin that you want (in your case XRP on Binance Exchange). \n\nTo send BTC from Coinbase to Binance, you want to copy your **BTC deposit address on Binance** and paste that address into the Send or Withdrawal section on Coinbase. Make sure the address is correct and that you copy and pasted the entire deposit address on Binance. If you use the wrong address you can lose your crypto forever. ",

        "comment": "So apparently what I think happened, is, I have been purchasing small increments of ETH, BTC, and LTC over the past few days, usually avg $200 buy, and I would use my checking account as payment method, and it would credit me immediately, which I thought was weird, because I thought bank transfers were supposed to take a few days?\n\nAnyways, I would check my bank statement, and place buys based on how much I have left in my bank account. So I bought all this, thinking that was exactly what I had enough for. But apparently, coinbase was crediting me the coins, and not charging my bank I think.... Most of these transfers would go through immediately and Id have the coin, but they did not show up on my bank statement, only some. Making me think that I was spending what I had enough for.\n\n\nSo apparently this is some kind of back payment because of their negligence in crediting me coins without charging me. I am in way over my head, I do not have nearly enough to pay this back. I did not know I spent this much, I would simply check my bank statement and buy based on that.\n\nThis is very negligent on their part, and I shouldn't have to pay for their mistakes. How can they credit me coins and not charge me? \n\nI dont know what to do. I do not have this kind of money, I put it all into altcoins. What will happen If I dont pay, or take a few months to pay?\n\nAnyone else have anything similar happen?\n\nWhat should I do? I already sent the coins to exchanges and bought altcoins with them, so I cant give them back.",

Pic: https://i.imgur.com/R4hUt5p.png\n\nIm new to this, just started maybe 3 weeks ago, and I got really carried away and over diversified my portfolio way too much.\n\nHowever certain coins in there have done me very well, particularly PRL, XRB, ETH, OMG, REQ and a few more, while others have dropped. Looking back, I would have just went with these 4. But now I have like 20+ different alts, some have performed well and some have lost, but because of the ones that did pump, im still at an overall profit, at least Doubled my initial investment in like 3 wks.\n\nWhat should I dump? TRX and XVG I assume? What else should I change? and if I have like 200-300$ to buy more, should I go for something I already have, or do you have any suggestions? Thanks!",

POE was another one I wasn't emotionally connected to and flipped after gaining 400% on it. \n\nPersonally, I see it two ways. There are folks that are better for holding their investments and sticking to a few cryptos and there are folks who are better at flipping. Odds are those that hold will get burned less than those who flip.\n\nTo state that the statement is \"wrong\" is to be far too arrogant towards the different styles of investors.

That is why it is so valuable. \n\nI hold XRB, I get that it has free and instant transactions, but it cannot yet handle Bitcoin/ETH's volume and there are security issues in its code. XRP is centralized banker shit. LTC is BTC. Bcash is a centralized Chinese pump and dump. IOTA has more functions than just a currency. ETH is a platform. If people want a decentralized crypto they can trust and Bitcoin solves scalability, please tell me why it wouldn't become the only currency coin that matters. ",

In their recent update Video interview, the co-founder stated that they will be shifting more resources to developing this protocol and on top of hiring more developers. Lastly, they have an upcoming Video AMA, so look forward to that.\n\nUltimately, I do believe that Enigma is still undervalued. It is not a niche product compared to most currencies that are above it in marketcap. Did I mention Enigma having a working product called Catalyst, albeit it is only for developers at the moment.\n\n",

        "comment": "> Say I owned XRP today and wanted to buy XRB. There is no option to move directly from one to the other.\n\nBTC is kind of the default currency. Imagine that you have a computer(XRP) and you decide that you want to get a couch(XRB) instead. First you'd sell your computer(XRP) to get money(BTC) so you can buy the couch(XRB). This is what you'd most likely do because it's highly likely that the person selling the couch has zero interest in a computer, but they'd rather take money because it's very versatile. \n\nI think that's the best way I can sum that up. Some exchanges may not carry XRP or XRB. But all exchanges carry BTC. ETH and LTC are kind of a default currency as well. \n",

When I started \"investing\" (it was only $2k so... not really an investment) I literally went through Coinmarketcap, picked up some cryptos that sounded interesting and just researched them on my own. Check their website, if it looks professional enough to warrant a second thought, check the team and their roadmap, I dont bother whith the whitepaper at first, but thats up to you. I usually start googling news, team members and stuff and then check out the subreddit of the coin. See if there are any videos on youtube that explain or try to explain what the coin does and if you feel like it seems good, check out reddit  for any threads on it. Good news, bad news? \n\nI think thats the only viable option right now because I dont trust a third party to make this decision for me.\n\nIf you are curios, this led me to holding XRP, ADA, ETH, QSP and POWER for the time im here and they all seem to do good. Oh and some BTC of course, just because I think everyone needs to support BTC because if this goes down the whole market is going to be set back a few years in terms of trust in the technology.",

        "comment": "To follow up on what u/jawpee123 said, cryptocurrencies are treated as a capital asset.  This means that you are taxed on the gain (or losses) of the value between the time you acquired it, and the time you get rid of it, in a situation known as a 'taxable event.'\n\nThe most typical taxable event is when you sell your bitcoins for cash, but swapping the asset for another asset, like a car, or even another cryptocurrency, also qualifies as a taxable event.\n\nSide note:  there was hope that the IRS would classify cryptocurrency exchanges as 'as-like', so if you, say, exchanged BTC for ETH, it wouldn't count as a taxable event, but, really, there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell of that actually happening.  The IRS confirmed that.",

        "comment": "I got started on Coinbase and only invested a little here and there in the big 3, and what may have been the most valuable lesson was that I bough in about two days before the big China crackdown.  I was in the red for all 3 (BTC/LTC/ETH) for over a month, and I was ready to kill my friends who got me interested in crypto.  But then I saw the coins climbing back and for whatever reason, I bought more.  It was not until early November that I made a Binance account and I got into Iota (based on a conversation I had with a guy at the gym sitting in the sauna lol).  I bought some Monero and Dash and that really opened my eyes.\n\nFast forward a bit and I dumped my dash, and I am now really high on REQ, IOTA, XRB, and NEO as solid projects with pretty bright futures, but by far I am most excited for VEN.  VEN looks just fantastic and is my largest holding right now.  I have also gotten my toes wet with some super small cap coins like WABI and WTC, and I might pick up some PRL.\n\nI am no expert and the market has treated me well, but I would say that a good mix of positions is a smart play.  Small market cap coins have the highest upside.  BTC is at ~300 billion market cap, so for it to double again would represent another 300 billion dollars being represented by BTC.  With smaller coins like WABI, we are only talking about another 500 million being represented for it to go 3.5x its current price.  Those are where to make your money and shotgunning small coins and hoping some will take off is a good way to catch massive gainers.\n\nIf you put $100 into ten small coins and 2 completely crash, 7 stay totally stagnant, and one goes 20x, you will be significantly up from where you started, and that is a very conservative estimation looking at where even big coins were a year ago.\n\nHappy hunting!",

I made 3x profit on VEN, sold at ATH and I bought NEO in a dip. I also held a couple NEO before, sold them at $50 and regretted it. I'm starting to feel like I want to shift my investments to viable platforms like NEO, ETH and ICX. We'll see how VEN can continue to grow (I still held 25% of my investment in), but I'm just happy that I got what I wanted. I think I'm going to accumulate my Ledger holdings with NEO for awhile.",

Anyone that wanted out has had a full week to get out.\n\nFor that reason, I think the typical behavior of being released on binance and dipping, then mooning is going to be very different for XRB. Not only that, but XRB is extremely impressive when you hold and trade it around. \n\nAs soon as people get the taste for what free instant transactions feel like, they will gobble this up. For example, I moved some ETH from Binance to Kucoin and it took like 45 minutes. I totally missed the dip I was trying to buy, and paid a fee which is a sunken cost. That shit HURTS and feels bad. If I had been able to do that with XRB, I would have caught the dip and paid no fees.\n\nIt's shilled like crazy, but honestly it's the single coin I'm the most confident holding longterm. Even more than ETH. That's a bold statement, and entirely personal opinion. \n\nI hope you DON'T buy any however, because I've been just slurping these up all week, and I want to keep doing that. I have no doubt that Summer-time \"me\" is going to be very happy with \"Winter-time\" me slurping up XRB before it hits binance.\n\nCould I make more by tossing a dart at a shitcoin? Possibly? But I also possibly just bought a rotten fish. \n\nI have no doubt with XRB that it's a good long term hold.",

Psychologically after hitting big on a couple alts I think you tend to chase that next big 2000% moonshot. At the same time if I had to bet I’d bet that BTC and ETH have the highest chance of being around in another two years compared to 99 percent of these alts. \n\nMy advice would be to have an exit plan in place to get money back into BTC/ETH and some of the stronger top twenty coins because those have the best chance of not going back to zero.

I go in and at the moment I have $125k invested spread out through 21 coins.\n\n$70k in ETH, followed by ENG at $9.5k, $7k BBT, ~$6k DBC, UFR, ICX, REQ, so forth and so on until a total of $125k is reached.\n\nNow I ask you, my serious and very very greedy goal is to have $5M EOY.\n\nSome of these coins have already x5+ with BNTY being worth $6k+ with an investment of only $1k.\n\nDo you think this is a good strategy or I am getting less value for my buck spreading out on so many coins?\n\nI'd like some input from people with expensive portfolios and their take on this.\n\nI know that some coins are very long term, I don't see ETH hitting $20k easily, that means BTC has to die or atleast flip it and ETH to have a market cap of trillions.\n\nI don't day trade.

QTUM, ICON, ETH, DragonChain, RHOC, are all competitors of Achain as well. You can see where this is going. \n\nAchain does not have a Reddit currently. Reddit serves as the main source of news and validation/verification of coin speculation through community dialogue and content sharing. Imagine what would happen to Achain once their subreddit IS created, and they FINALLY begin marketing towards the West? \n\nAchain is hugely undervalued from a technical analysis standpoint, AND a fundamental position as well.",

        "comment": "The more you spread the risk, the less likely you are to lose big when you pick a loser. If one of your coins fails then the rest of the portfolio keeps you profitable. Same concept as an index fund. Some individual stocks (coins) may fall but with enough spread the likelihood of your portfolio continuing to grow (excluding an market-wide crash) is pretty good. \n\nIt comes down to risk tolerance. Of course if you'd have invested $100k in BNTY instead of $1k you'd be pretty damn happy right now, but only because it went up. The more concentrated your portfolio is AND the higher risk coins you hold, the more potential for big losses. \n\nYou currently have over 50% of your portfolio in ETH which is a good way to mitigate losses as it's quite stable and should give you consistent (but smaller) gains. You could of course throw that $70k into the next shilled moon coin and hope to turn it into $1m, but obviously the risk versus holding ETH increases considerably.\n\nThere's no perfect answer here because every strategy has its pros and cons. There's no one way to make good money at this game, just like there are no foolproof ways to avoid losing money. \n\nSorry if that isn't helpful, but only you can decide how much risk you'll tolerate. Higher risk = higher potential returns (and failure). ",

This is based on the variance of a sum of random things being smaller if their correlation is negative. \n\nAn explanation not included yet is that if you decide on day 1 that it makes sense to invest 25% in each of BTC, ETH, LTC and DOGE as a portfolio, then a few weeks down the line the same logic should hold. But if one of these has taken a temporary dive then you know its going to come back up again since these are not just hype.\n\nIf I was trying to make money on hype, pump and dump, then none of this applies. That is just plain not interesting as fas as I'm concerned: Might as well go to the Casino.\n\n",

        "comment": "**AIX**    \n  \nAn interesting project bringing insurance to the blockchain. I was initially put off by the huge scope of the project, but there are use cases I think could happen in 2018. For example, in India and Africa they are currently using satellite imagery and drones to offer automated crop insurance. Not only is this cheaper for farmers and insurance companies, but the results are overwhelmingly positive as the insurance is paid out quickly enough so that crops can be replanted. It's really a groundbreaking idea, and it makes a lot of sense to move this to the blockchain.  \n  \nI expected the valuation to be around $300M after checking out their site -- when I saw that it was $40M (based on a 29M circulating supply) I bought in immediately. I then realized I could buy in for even cheaper, so accumulated even more.    \n  \nActual circulating supply is 17M, average price now is $5 on kucoin -- giving an $85M marketcap. IMO, this is severely underpriced.  \n  \nBased on Kucoin price model discussed in canyacoin section, I expect more price movement to occur after 4-5 days and after listing on CMC is filled out (and it has a place in the top 200).  \n  \nHowever, this is more of a bluechip project than some of the others discussed, so price movement is likely to occur earlier. Also, there is probably a recognition starting now that projects on kucoin are undervalued even after a big increase on the first day.  \n  \nWe should remember most recent ICOs coming to market now were priced out in a market that was $100B -- now 7 times that. So the project was probably undervalued by 7x at ICO price, so there's a lot of room for price movement.  \n  \nMy price target is $12-14 by January 18, with a likely peak $4-6 higher than that (if market is stable).     \n  \n**Disclaimer**  \nBought in on AIX yesterday ~0.0008 ETH average price on etherdelta.  \nI started a subreddit /r/cryptobriefs .. not much there yet, but if you like my info I'll be posting more there   \n  ",

Assuming businesses buy in and continue to buy in to the XRapid platform, which uses XRP to blow away old time money transfer systems, demand for the token should increase, which would push up the price. Mass adoption to handle the billions that are moved worldwide should help demand and in turn push up price.\n\nAt this point, no one truly knows where the line will be drawn on full potential. Maybe it only ever sees up to $5 or $20 USD. Maybe the world goes topsy turvy and it somehow touches where ETH is now - while I have my doubts (and dreams!) I want to illustrate the breadth of uncertainty.\n\nI apologize if this is not exceptionally helpful; it is an honest observation going off of information I've internalized.",

        "comment": "Oh yeah your intent was so totally clear from the statement \"See: Request Network,\" if you want to make a more nuanced point like you are trying to now, you should have typed that in the first place. I think it's a bit strong to say I sound like a retard because I can't read your mind and deduce exactly what you mean from such a totally ambiguous statement. The antecedent was that there would only be a few true cryptocurrencies, and you replied mentioning request with no other details; in the context of the conversation it sounded to me, and I suspect to others as well, like you were positing that request would be one of those 2-3 cryptocurrencies. \n\nIf you intended to say that request would make that irrelevant you should have typed that in the first place; and that doesn't change the fact there is still no benefit to holding random coins, as the value of any one currency is only relevant to its demand so just because you could use any currency interchangeably, why would that radically alter the paradigm that people will primarily want to purchase particular currencies. In theory, those with the fastest speeds, most network resilience, and lowest fees will be the ones adopted; you can factor in the network adoption effect as well. Just because request will in the future allow you to use bitcoin, that won't make it faster nor cheaper so if enough people actually intend to use it as a currency and not a store of value, a different coin will be adopted and prioritized. You really think that just because you can pay in tittiecoin, that that will mean it will be valuable? Interoperability doesn't change the fact some coins will be prioritized. \n\nBesides, if you think this is the draw of request you are sorely mistaken; REQ is about smart audits and payment processing; while the white paper stipulates the ability to pay in any currency, currently they have no way to facilitate fiat and no real plan for how to implement it, and all the currency interoperability is provided by the 0x and kyber network backbone, and the integration into Request NOT Request itself. Any Ethereum based project can integrate 0x and kyber so that's not the draw, and currently all that means is that you can do on-chain exchanges of ETH and ERC20 tokens. Sure they want to integrate oracles for cross chain payment into REQ but if that's your jam then you are way better off looking into ICON and OMG as they are more promising on that front than REQ. REQ is about smart auditing first and foremost, hence that's what the technical yellowpaper is about, and easy integration with merchant services.  \n\nBut yes, *I* am the one who sounds like a retard.

These are the platforms which I believe the future of most crypto currencies will be built upon. Look at the top 100 coins, most are ERC tokens. These also (2 out of 4) currently generate passive income for doing nothing more than simply holding the coin. VEN will soon be generating THOR by EOQ2, and I see things around about ETH going to POS which I presume might generate a bit of passive income also. \n\nI highly believe in these platforms for the long term and am speculating that the prices will increase enough for my positions to be able to give me enough income to quit my job and go do my own thing. The total portfolio value by that time would need to be big, but I think 1 year out there is a lot to gain using this strategy and in the following years there will be more (albeit, perhaps less substantial gains) gains to be had along with the passive income. \n\nGoing back to ERC20 tokens being a majority of the top 100 coins, this is evidence to me that there is so much at stake for Ethereum that will will not simply disappear. This is a very unlikely scenario IMO. Prices might level off, but with the ecosystems these platforms are building they will not be disappearing anytime soon. ",

Maybe ETH will, since it has many different uses.\n\nBut realistically all of these coins these days are like Gen 1 coins. With BTC being the prototype. So likely most will fade away as teams with better visions and budgets come in.\n\nI read all of these whitepapers looking for something that seems solid, and just keep seem trash on trash on trash but still 500m to 1b evaluations. Some of them have bigger market caps than the industries they are looking to supplement. \n\nI think there will need to be an altcoin crash to wipe out the hundreds of shitcoins. Maybe 5-6 will come out the other side as leaders, and then hopefully more serious dev teams will come in scoop up the findings and fill the market place gap.\n\nOr you could maybe argue these are Gen 2 coins, and the first time BTC crashed, those were the Gen 1 coins. \n\nEither way I think it will take 3 crashes until we have coins that will see large scale adoption. \n\n",

        "comment": "No, not necessarily. High fees are mostly seen in Proof of Work systems like BTC and ETH (ETH will move over to PoS shortly, but still). In PoW systems miners basically have to be rewarded for \"unlocking\" coins and \"confirming\" transactions  (simplistically put). This is why they're energy inefficient  (BTC mining uses more power now annually than the entire country of the Netherlands -17 million souls- does) and expensive in transaction fees.\n\nIn Proof of Stake mechanisms there is no need for mining. Coins holders stake their coins instead. Way less energy consuming  (negligible) and cheap transactions. The stakers do still need to get rewarded for staking their coins though, so there will always be some fees.\n\nNow NEO uses an entirely different mechanism to ensure fast and low cost transactions. The network runs on bookkeeper nodes (let's say servers). These bookkeepers are holders of the NEO token and get voted in by other NEO holders. For running a node they receive a small fee per transaction. However, they can't charge too much, otherwise the NEO community will just vote in another bookkeeper who is willing to run the node for lower fees! This is called decentralization through coopetition.\n\nThe above is just an example. There are many varieties. Almost as many varieties as there are cryptos I would Imagine (I just happen to know the mechanisms of NEO best).\n\nHope this helped. ",

Since then I've actually been pretty enthused by the idea of actually being able to use crypto some day as well to like... buy things!\n\nMy only real regret was turning half my ETH into XRP/XLM/REQ/NEO/OMG.

My plan is to basically hold about 1/4 in ETH, 1/8 in BTC, and the rest spread between 3 medium caps and 5 smallcaps that could explode or die.

I understand where he's coming from, and to me it makes sense.\n\nNow that doesn't mean there isn't some good money to be made trading crypto in the short and medium term, possibly even in the long term. But IMO you'd be a fool to buy *any* coins today with a 10 year lock on them. Would you buy any BTC or ETH today if you were obligated to hold on to it for 10 years? I wouldn't.

I only get alt coins when I can immediately replace my “fund coin”. I’m willing to lose money on both—short term. But, the worst feeling is when you let go of an ETH for an XYZ, and the ETH immediately runs, while XYZ dips. \n\nAt least only trading when you can immediately replace your fund coin, you only are exposed to financial loss, and one type of psychological loss, as opposed to two psychological losses.

        "comment": "You're right, but actually both of you are. You have made a profit, but it came with an opportunity cost, or an \"economic loss\". Yes you now have $250 more than you started with, but you missed out on an additional $250.\n\n\nHere's an example: say you're an experienced engineer making $100k per year. You're pretty good at your job and you know you could probably get a similar salary at almost any company because you're hot shit. But let's pretend you've always wanted to be a farmer, it might not make sense but it's been your dream since you were a kid. So one day you work up the courage to buy the land and equipment and everything you need, and finally gather the courage to quit your job so you can go farming. After one year, you grew a bunch of carrots or whatever and sold them. After paying all your farming expenses, you pocket  $50,000 dollars. This is an *accounting* profit, because you made more money than you took in, but it's also an *economic loss*. Since you walked away from a job that would've paid you $100k that year, farming basically cost you $50k that year.\n\n\nThis is the point OP is trying to make, but I think a lot of times the meaning is lost when people don't say it clearly. I too only care about how much my portfolio gains in fiat, but it's important to know how one of your alt coins performed against your base pair because maybe you'll make money, but if it underperformed against ETH you missed out on more potential gains. This is especially bad when you consider that examplecoin probably is a riskier bet than something as \"established\" as ETH. So it's incorrect to say fiat gains are meaningless, but it's also important to know even if you turn a profit, if you could've had more buy just keeping the money in your base pair.",

NEO is basically telling everyone what they want to hear, using the the most exciting words and concepts to draw people in. It might work, but that's all it is. \n\n>You can read this objective analysis why VEN is undervalued.\n\nI've read that analysis. It's very good. It also assumes that VEN creates tremendous demand for the THOR token. Nobody knows right now if that's true, or how much money is going to spent on THOR in Y1, Y2, or Y3.\n\nI'll tell you, it's highly unlikey the supply chain industry spends over a billion dollars on a new and untested technology in Y1. I've been a regulator my whole life. Nobody in any industry swaps out infrastructure like that without beta testing and scaling integration. \n\nThe ironic part of VEN, is that speculators attempting to ride a wave of profits might severely overvalue a solid technological use for a cryptocurrency., Tokens like VEN are so clear on what you get and how it works, that overvaluation is easier to spot. \n\nVEN may go to $40 a token. Great for holders. Say you hold 1000 VEN. That's $40,000. It's also 150 THOR. What if you get $1 per THOR on the market. THat's $150 a year for a $40,000 investment. AKA dog shit. The price will tank. That COULD happen. \n\nBeware of speculators. If anyone kills VEN, it'll be them.",

Maybe BTC's flaws are fixed and it becomes useful, but I don't see it right now. People say \"digital gold\" but real gold doesn't require the resources that BTC requires just to exist. Is all of that power eaten up by mining really worth a store of value? Only when the store of value is rapidly appreciating imo. When that stops, I don't think BTC is very useful. \n\nSome of the alts have much more potential to be useful in 5 years than BTC. There are coins that can be an anonymous exchange of value, there are coins that can be a low cost exchange of value and there are coins that can execute code in a proveably secure and decentralized manner. All of those uses seem to have genuine value.

If I'm purchasing Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin simply to get it to an exchange to purchase more VEN, I really don't see why I need to be looking at the price of BTC/ETH compared to my VEN even though they are trading pairs. The price of BTC/ETH may go up or down depending on how long it takes to get to the exchange, but other than that I don't really care; I'm holding the base pair for less than an hour. If my goal was to accumulate more BTC, I definitely get it - but that's not what I'm doing. This could be a terrible way of looking at it, but in 2017 all my bills are paid in fiat.

Now I see the LTC as healthy correction, but then it was all just \"losses.\"\n\nNow I still have a significant position on LTC but I've diverted funds into BTC as well as some other large-mid cap coins. I know not to day-trade. But my question is this: do you smart investors swing trade often? I'm absorbing as much as I can about how to read tradingview charts and use the indicators, but I don't want to fall into the trap of doing 1 trade a day trying to predict things. How often are you guys trading? Or are you simply researching projects you believe in and investing and leaving it?\n\nThanks a lot.",

There's no way to gain that 0.0125 BTC you supposedly 'threw away' if you're planning on cashing out.  If you cash out directly to fiat, you 'threw it away'.  If you cash out to BTC, you still 'threw it away'.  Your only option is to HOLD until your 0.0375 BTC is worth 0.05BTC or more again and THEN transfer it to BTC as profit.  If that the goal?  So what this comes down to is that the goal with alts is to hopefully rapidly increase their value relative to BTC/ETH and then absorb profits to either BTC or ETH or whatever you believe is your main anchor?  Also, does any of this even make a difference if my plan is to just  HOLD HOLD HOLD my alts?  ",

All these first world kiddies who like to complain about BTC's power consumption from their iPhones, sweatshop made designer clothes, and air conditioned homes were all over BCH's dick it simply b/c it ate into BTC's market dominance. None of them cared that BCH uses as much power as BTC and why would they? None of these people have ever done shit for sustainability before except whine on an internet forum about Bitcoin. If Vitalik suddenly said ETH would keep PoW they would suddenly be evangelizing how PoW is far more secure than PoS (and it is) and they would be making arguments as to why the power consumption isn't a big deal.\n\nOccasionally something new gets shilled here I haven't heard about and this is the ONLY reason I come to this sub.\n",

So when a market dip is happening and people are panicking, everyone first cashes their alts out for ETH. Then they have to send that ETH to something like GDAX or Gemini, which doesn't happen instantly. A lot of time these exchanges get overloaded during panic sells and the order can take forever. So it feels like in general that the price of alts will always fall a lot faster, whereas ETH/BTC can get hung up in transfers. They also have a substantially larger market cap than most alts, which means it is more difficult to influence the price.",

This will allow you to then move funds to the exchanges which will then allow you to trade altcoins.  Ethereum will transfer faster to the exchanges.  Binance, Cryptopia, Kucoin, Gate.io, CoinExchange.io are the common exchanges currently accepting new customers\n\nCoinMarketCap - website that shows you trends and available exchanges for all coins.  You can see which exchanges have specific coins available for trading and whether they can be traded using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc\n\nCoinStats - an app where you can track your investments and there progress.  I'm sure there are others but this one has worked well for me\n\nThe above should get you started.  Simplified, you deposit into Coinbase, transfer to GDax using the GDax website and then transfer from GDax to an exchange using a coin specific address.  The last part is very important...you can only send BTC to a Bitcoin address so please triple check that you are sending the correct coin to an address designated for that coin.  If you send BTC to an ETH address you may lose all funds.  You should probably practice with smaller transactions as you begin to invest and do multiple transactions to ensure you do not lose large sums of money.  \n\nThis subreddit and /r/altcoin are helpful for the coins aside from the big 4.  If you want free coins you need to be on the lookout for ICOs.  \n\nGood luck",

This advice was perfectly right for a long time, but it was in large part due to BTC being the only trading pair. 2017 changed everything and BTC has lost that power very much to ETH. It is always incredibly slow to transfer between exchanges and wallets and the fees are painful. Additionally, BTC no longer has such an enormous portion of the crypto market and it may very well get passed in the next few months in market cap. Bitcoin and alts are fairly decoupled already and in not very much time it really won't matter what Bitcoin does because alts won't be impacted. \n\nDon't buy the BTC dip anymore.

I conservatively put in NEO and maintained some in ETH. I did those when NEO was in ATH and before this FUD drama. Today, after seeing so many reds (I also have considerable APPC), I feel very lucky that 50% of my portfolio is on NEO and ETH. It saved me from loosing my mind. Going forward, I'm going to trust NEO/ETH, and will maintain half of my portfolio in it.",

Some safe coins to look into for a beginner are ICX, VEN, XLM, ENG, REQ.  XLM is actually overdue to go up and is at a really good price right now.  Do your own research first, though.  Try and buy them when their prices dip a little.  Make sure you do research on coins before you buy, so you don't end up with bullshit like TRX.  It's basically a scam coin.\n\nAlso, as for the price of a coin, you need to look at the market cap as well.  The price doesn't matter.  TRON is $.10, but it has one of the highest market caps out of all of the coins because there are 65 billion of them circulating.  This isn't a bad thing for a coin to have a lot of circulating coins, but it is the reason some of the bigger coins look cheap.  Check out https://coinmarketcap.com",

There is a lot of account registering, password creation, and 2FA enabling, but security is important. Make sure you dont use the same passwords for exhanges wallets or your email obviously. I leave a good bit in my exchange wallet, but that is much less secure then sending it off exchange. You may have to pay fees to pull some coins out of exchanges, and wallets generally have minimum storage fees. Binance, an exchange, offers a lot of coins you listed (XLM,TRX,DOGE) and many more, its my favorite exchange. That and Kucoin (another exchange) will have your head spinning on options. Kucoin you can get XRB, its one of my most excited for coins, and ITS ON SALE with the market dip. Eth is pretty much a universal transfer currency on most exchanges but also could be worth holding a good bit if you are less risk averse. Lots of other coins are essentially just eth at the end of the day.",

This channels dates back some considerable time (September) but we clearly broke out of this channel on the massive bull run that saw XLM go to the top ten.\n\nThe correction would've been over and we likely would have seen some sideways movement from the 6th onwards but the FUD (Korean Exchanges & Chinese Mining) created a downwards channel. When we dropped to $0.48 (that recent big red candle) we bounced on the old channel and seem to be heading towards the collapsing triangle.\n\nAt this point XLM is likely to make a move, either by breaking up, following the old channel top for slow growth or falling back into the old channel. Could go as low as $0.30 to the bottom of the channel (but this strikes me as unlikely) or if it breaks up it'll encounter resistance at $0.66 where the previous correction reversed.\n\nAll speculation of course and Crypto loves to laugh at TA, but there you go.",

The whales want you to sell your XLM right now, and once they have accumulated enough, the walls will come down and boom!",

I posted this earlier today and the bounce is solid:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vhPYb\n\nI'd suggest we're bouncing pretty well off of the bottom of the log chart and are more likely going to hit the middle of the log channel which is $0.9. We might possibly fall just short of that target, but last time the log channel only hit the middle was when it went from $0.19 to $0.33, before then exploding up to the ATH of $0.99. Most reassuring is the breakout from the lower highs, seen with the lower teal line. If we can break out from the descending line of the ATH I'm feeling confident about a breakout:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ovNdp\n\nEssentially I feel like now is the time to get into XLM. That + BTC is stabilizing back to $14k and I'm a firm believer that a stable BTC means growth for alts.\n\nAs always, this is just my perspective and you should do your own research and make your own trades at your own risk.",

See my previous post here where for some reason the stars have aligned and my TA of XLM is so far spot on because crypto is behaving for perhaps the first time ever: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pm5f6/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2018/dsisstl/\n\nAnd now given the resistance line has been broken (I bet it fails as I type this) I'm going to go bold and make a prediction based on previous log channel growth. If we fall out of this log channel (around $0.43) then it'll be gameover for XLM for the time being. But if not! Bold prediction:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/tK0OV0b\n\n$1.25 by the 17th?! You bet. But a man can dream. This is using the previous growth from end of December to start of Jan as a prediction. It's shorter because Log charts for you new guys out there.\n\n(Trade at your own discretion not on my advice, do your own research and I could be wrong as fuckkkkk)\n",

But, what you won't see, since it's run on the Stellar Network, FairX will process the transaction as FIAT > XLM > COIN. Also, since XLM's transfer fee is at .01c(.001xlm) for any transaction, it's likely FairX will have relatively cheap fees compared to what we've been exposed to in today's market. ",

I've been told to not focus on the USD price (which I've been doing) but rather the SAT value. \n\nSo if I buy XLM at 0.000005 BTC and sell for 0.000004 BTC, do I lose money regardless of what the USD value is of the alt due to BTC going up?\n\nI figure if I have $100 and use it all to buy XLM at 0.000005, even if XLM goes down to 0.000004 but BTC goes up and my USD value for the entire holding is $125 for example, my current buying power would be $125 in BTC which allows me to buy more of another alt compared to my original $100 even though I sold at a lower SAT value.\n\nFrom what I've read other people saying, I'm wrong.

Hopefully everyone eventually knowing this will increase price, but I don't think this behind the screens action effects the XLM price at all.

I don’t think that they are necessarily Battling each other to be the “True Bitcoin”, I see BTC as being more of a long term value storage and BCH being more transactional. It has faster transactions and lower transaction fees than BTC. \n\nLTC is so quick. If you want to get someone into cryptos, send them some LTC or XLM. They are super fast, having someone wait 10-20 minutes to confirm a transaction can really take the air out of their sails. It takes about a quarter of the time to generate a LTC block as it does one for BTC.\n\nAlso, both LTC and BCH are listed on Coinbase which is the most user friendly (although not fee friendly) way to purchase cryptos. Investors who are intimidated exchanges and intimidated by investing in lesser known alt coins will just diversify their crypto portfolio using the options available in Coinbase.\n\nThose are my bullish pros on the coins but I’m definitely open to hearing the other side as well. Hell, I welcome the Cons - helps me know what to look out for in this crazy, sick game of cryptos.",

So in other cases let's say there is a developing country and you want to send money but can't send your Fiat to their Fiat through traditional exchanges.

Here is the quote from Michael Dowling's AMA. There are also the Stellar ATMs being rolled out this year.\n\n> Hyperledger Fabric records the clearing operations of a transfer of value (I️.e. the boring regulatory stuff, like KYC/AML/CTF processes), and decides on the right settlement path for the specific transaction.

As part of its custodial mandate, SDF is entrusted to oversee that the vast majority, 95 billion, of the lumens are distributed to the world.\n[...] By implementing a simple mechanism for distribution featuring a low barrier to entry, we hope to distribute free lumens to millions of individuals.\"\n\nhttps://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/",

However much is left over is locked backed up and the next month it is still only 1b offered.\n\n> saying xrp is centralized because Ripple owns 60% of the coins is totally wrong?\n\nOwning 60% of any coin is, I guess, similar to it being centralized if we are speaking about the worth of the coin for trading. If I owned 60% of BTC I could essentially be the centralized owner, but it is a stretch.\n\nRipple is centralized because ripple owns/owned (not 100% sure) all of the nodes. They are actually [decentralizing](https://ripple.com/insights/how-we-are-further-decentralizing-the-ripple-consensus-ledger-rcl-to-bolster-robustness-for-enterprise-use/) as we speak and have been since the beginning.\n\nA quote from that article:\n\n> As we continue these initiatives to further decentralize the system, XRP Ledger will inherently become even more resilient. **A key benchmark that we aim to achieve is to become *more decentralized than Bitcoin*,** which at the time of writing is 51% controlled by just five mining pools. This means the largest five pools working together could achieve a 51% attack and reverse transactions (double spend) at will. For Ethereum, this number is even lower: only three pools are needed for a takeover. To match Bitcoin, XRP Ledger would need just 16 trusted validators. Add more, and the number of tolerable faults increases accordingly. In other words, XRP Ledger will not just meet, but exceed the decentralization level of other public blockchains.",

You could still transfer Bitcoin.\n\nCan you imagine what's going to happen if the entire Bitcoin network freezes?.\n\nNo transactions being sent ANYWHERE. It would kill every Crypto out there. It would destroy the entire system. \n\nIt would be way harder to get around than something simple like being able to participate in ICO's or use an Exchange.\n\nWe're talking about *physical* hardware. That's using a shit load of electricity. They can't hide that stuff. And when China starts pulling plugs and shutting BTC down, it's gonna hurt. **Bad**.\n\nThis is a side effect of being entirely too dependent upon Bitcoin, which is not **at all** decentralized. It's exclusively controlled by China. And they don't want it around anymore.\n\nWe need to move on from Bitcoin and start adopting *any* of the dozens of coins which are superior to Bitcoin in *every single way*.\n\n",

If the exchange rate is $1.61/£1.00 then your initial investment is $1610.\n\n3 months later you buy: A dick ton of ripple with 0.5 BTC. \n\nBTC price at the time is $3200.  (I’d advise not going back into GBP, rather just cash back into USD)\nTherefore, assuming your short-term capital gains taxes is approx 40%, $640 in taxes for transacting on the market. \n\nThe revisions in the new tax bill changing the like-kind exchange code’s 1031 wording from “property” to “real property” really fucks everything up.\n\nHowever what many don’t realize is if you do a Like-Kind exchange, you must 1. fill a form 1031 form out within 45 days of the exchange 2. This must be a direct transfer of equal value from person to person. No intermediaries. An exchange counts as an intermediary.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research and this is why I’m looking for literally anything I can do to minimize the incoming tax nightmare...",

My hardware actually busting the highest hashrates if ever seen those algos go before... On that HAL coin (Halcyon)...\nSit back, go out for a smoke...\nCome back and the dashboard actually said (I digress this happened before the decefeit watching)...\nMy dashboard was displaying that I was mining \"HBC\" coin... \nWtf? Supposed to be HAL...\n\nthis is one of those sites that (after reading the FINE PRINT).. Have a little disclaimer that if you don't include your password as -p c=HAL (HAL or BTC or ETH) etc... Then they don't reject your hashes they just keep that going on... And in tiny print tell you it's your fault...\n(Which it is) \n\nBecause that's a common practice of designating coin in pool algos running...no doubt...\n\nBut for those that hadn't seen that designation specification, ...ooo free hashpowaa for site owners for sure...\n\nAlso any unclaimed unpayed shares for 60 days are \"purged\"... (Code for \"theirs\")...\n\n...so that warning that I posted before, now reads...\n\n\"We are short of this currency (241.39375886 HAL). Please STOP your miners and switch to BTC until we find more HAL blocks.\nYOU are responsible if you continue to mine for HAL despite this warning.\"\n\nLol... So no doubt people saw that $48 profit on the top of whattomine, set up their miners, set their currency password, then left their miners humming and left the house... \nThen conveniently they get the message when AFK or checking dashboard remotely... And can't turn it off...\n\nSo you can imagine the giant sucking sound that has echoed through that site since then...\n\n\n....or maybe it's just a conventional issue and I don't know what the eff in talking about....\n\nTheir Coins' home site needs a redo.\nCool name and symbol.\nWallet wouldn't sync...\nStinky.",

As it scales they're either going to have to shard it or go with off-chain transactions, both of which will reduce the utility of that one fundamental thing it offers which is meant to be better than other options.\n\nnstead of paying a third party of known credibility, you're paying an anonymous network to do whatever aspect of the smart contract you want done.\n\nAnd every contract that works to complete another adds another layer of fees so if it really does take off, it's going to become even more expensive to use than BTC.",

        "comment": "It's fucking ridiculous because when I trade stocks I have very clear records of exactly how much USD everything was bought and sold for. With crypto when I'm trading alt to alt and neither can be exchanged directly for USD, exactly how much were they worth at the time of the trade? The exchange doesn't keep detailed records of this. Am I to assume they are worth the USD value of BTC? What if ETH overtakes BTC in marketcap or volume, do I switch over to tracking my prices in that? Do I track the value of USD / BTC on that exchange if they have a pair for it, or do I use the overall market average at that point in time? Meanwhile if I place a limit order and it sells overnight how am I supposed to know what the USD value was at the time the trade was executed? Crypto is super volatile and coinmarketcap only keeps records in hourly increments; that could be 10% difference or more sometimes and as the exchange doesn't keep track of the USD value at sale except for USD pairs I have no records for this. I mean I'm trying to do my best to navigate this regulatory minefield but it's a fucking nightmare. The taxcode really is not cut out for this shit. \n\nThe entire you need to pay taxes as you go on gains but can only claim losses against future capital gains is just a fucked up system, and I mean this for all commodities. So say I hold 1 billion dollars in crypto holdings and the market collapses, that does me a lot of good after I've paid hundreds of million dollars in taxes I don't get back. But oh wait, I can deduct $3000 in income from my next years tax return, fucking lol. The government can go fuck themselves; I fucking hate this country. ",

        "comment": "Hi. I'm unfamiliar with your WA state laws, but typically to purchase XRP or any other alt coin (alt-coin being defined as any coin not BTC or ETH or LTC), you purchase BTC or ETH on a \"cash-to-crypto\" site like Coinbase or Gemini. In your case you purchased BTC on Coinbase. We specifically purchase BTC or ETH because on exchanges that carry a lot of alt-coins, they are typically paired with BTC or ETH meaning we trade BTC or ETH for the alt coin that you want (in your case XRP on Binance Exchange). \n\nTo send BTC from Coinbase to Binance, you want to copy your **BTC deposit address on Binance** and paste that address into the Send or Withdrawal section on Coinbase. Make sure the address is correct and that you copy and pasted the entire deposit address on Binance. If you use the wrong address you can lose your crypto forever. ",

        "comment": "So apparently what I think happened, is, I have been purchasing small increments of ETH, BTC, and LTC over the past few days, usually avg $200 buy, and I would use my checking account as payment method, and it would credit me immediately, which I thought was weird, because I thought bank transfers were supposed to take a few days?\n\nAnyways, I would check my bank statement, and place buys based on how much I have left in my bank account. So I bought all this, thinking that was exactly what I had enough for. But apparently, coinbase was crediting me the coins, and not charging my bank I think.... Most of these transfers would go through immediately and Id have the coin, but they did not show up on my bank statement, only some. Making me think that I was spending what I had enough for.\n\n\nSo apparently this is some kind of back payment because of their negligence in crediting me coins without charging me. I am in way over my head, I do not have nearly enough to pay this back. I did not know I spent this much, I would simply check my bank statement and buy based on that.\n\nThis is very negligent on their part, and I shouldn't have to pay for their mistakes. How can they credit me coins and not charge me? \n\nI dont know what to do. I do not have this kind of money, I put it all into altcoins. What will happen If I dont pay, or take a few months to pay?\n\nAnyone else have anything similar happen?\n\nWhat should I do? I already sent the coins to exchanges and bought altcoins with them, so I cant give them back.",

I posted this earlier today and the bounce is solid:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vhPYb\n\nI'd suggest we're bouncing pretty well off of the bottom of the log chart and are more likely going to hit the middle of the log channel which is $0.9. We might possibly fall just short of that target, but last time the log channel only hit the middle was when it went from $0.19 to $0.33, before then exploding up to the ATH of $0.99. Most reassuring is the breakout from the lower highs, seen with the lower teal line. If we can break out from the descending line of the ATH I'm feeling confident about a breakout:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ovNdp\n\nEssentially I feel like now is the time to get into XLM. That + BTC is stabilizing back to $14k and I'm a firm believer that a stable BTC means growth for alts.\n\nAs always, this is just my perspective and you should do your own research and make your own trades at your own risk.",

Waiting 1 year will result in a long terms gains trade into BTC, resulting in the cost-basis for BTC to be whatever price you traded at. So selling into fiat from BTC will be a net gain of zero, so you won't be taxed there. The gain taxed will be from altcoin to bitcoin, so you have to hold your alt for a year to get long-term gains.

        "comment": "**New to Crypto disclaimer -  Question about exchanges.\n\nI hope someone can answer this question. So I know that BTC is the standard that most (all?) altcoins are based off of. And I just made my first coin purchases literally days ago. But one thing that really bothers me about all exchanges is the need to move back and forth to BTC when trying to go from one altcoin to another.\n\n**Is there a reason exchanges don't do the conversion to and from BTC for you on the back end?** Say I owned XRP today and wanted to buy XRB. There is no option to move directly from one to the other. \n\nIf it is the doubling of fees, then just include that in the transaction fee. I posed this question to a friend and he said you would need a separate market for every single coin combination. But I disagree. The individual exchange would/should allow for Market Orders where you can go from any coin to another and still use BTC as the intermediary but the exchange handles you for that on the back end. I recognize that this wouldn't work for limit orders.\n\nThe advantage would not only allow for immediate transfer from one altcoin to another but would also potentially cut the amount of tax reporting in half as the exchange would handle the transaction immediately and you don't have to report the purchase of and immediate sale of BTC. Even though it would be an increase in fees for this offering, wouldn't this be advantageous for the consumer?\n\nAm I missing something here? Is this incredibly hard to implement on the exchange side? Is there more risk involved even though it would be market rate purchases? I feel like someone would have thought of this already.",

That is why it is so valuable. \n\nI hold XRB, I get that it has free and instant transactions, but it cannot yet handle Bitcoin/ETH's volume and there are security issues in its code. XRP is centralized banker shit. LTC is BTC. Bcash is a centralized Chinese pump and dump. IOTA has more functions than just a currency. ETH is a platform. If people want a decentralized crypto they can trust and Bitcoin solves scalability, please tell me why it wouldn't become the only currency coin that matters. ",

        "comment": "> Say I owned XRP today and wanted to buy XRB. There is no option to move directly from one to the other.\n\nBTC is kind of the default currency. Imagine that you have a computer(XRP) and you decide that you want to get a couch(XRB) instead. First you'd sell your computer(XRP) to get money(BTC) so you can buy the couch(XRB). This is what you'd most likely do because it's highly likely that the person selling the couch has zero interest in a computer, but they'd rather take money because it's very versatile. \n\nI think that's the best way I can sum that up. Some exchanges may not carry XRP or XRB. But all exchanges carry BTC. ETH and LTC are kind of a default currency as well. \n",

When I started \"investing\" (it was only $2k so... not really an investment) I literally went through Coinmarketcap, picked up some cryptos that sounded interesting and just researched them on my own. Check their website, if it looks professional enough to warrant a second thought, check the team and their roadmap, I dont bother whith the whitepaper at first, but thats up to you. I usually start googling news, team members and stuff and then check out the subreddit of the coin. See if there are any videos on youtube that explain or try to explain what the coin does and if you feel like it seems good, check out reddit  for any threads on it. Good news, bad news? \n\nI think thats the only viable option right now because I dont trust a third party to make this decision for me.\n\nIf you are curios, this led me to holding XRP, ADA, ETH, QSP and POWER for the time im here and they all seem to do good. Oh and some BTC of course, just because I think everyone needs to support BTC because if this goes down the whole market is going to be set back a few years in terms of trust in the technology.",

This means that you are taxed on the gain (or losses) of the value between the time you acquired it, and the time you get rid of it, in a situation known as a 'taxable event.'\n\nThe most typical taxable event is when you sell your bitcoins for cash, but swapping the asset for another asset, like a car, or even another cryptocurrency, also qualifies as a taxable event.\n\nSide note:  there was hope that the IRS would classify cryptocurrency exchanges as 'as-like', so if you, say, exchanged BTC for ETH, it wouldn't count as a taxable event, but, really, there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell of that actually happening.

        "comment": "I'm not quite sure what you are asking with your initial question. As for BCH and XRP--\n\nBCH is a branch of Bitcoin (they used to both be the same thing, but they branched off in August and everyone who owned one Bitcoin at that time was given one BCH and one Bitcoin. This is called a \"fork\".) The main difference between BCH and BTC is that BCH has a larger block size, meaning that more transactions can be processed every 10 minutes when a new block is mined. This results in less fees and faster transaction times. The tradeoff for this is that this makes running a full BCH node is more difficult than in BTC, so the network is more centralized. Less people control more of the network. It should also be noted that fees for BCH are lower because less people use BCH, and this likely mostly why BCH fees are less.\n\nI admittedly don't know as much about how XRP works, but as I understand it, it is more like Visa than Bitcoin in that Ripple controls most of the network and has control over the transactions. This might not be completely true, but it certainly is much more centralized than almost all other cryptocurrencies. The tradeoff for this is that fees are much less (as they would be if you processed a financial transaction using Visa or some other credit card which is centralized.) Some people believe that this defeats the purpose of a cryptocurrency.",

LTC gets to watch BTC make a move or a fork or what have you, and then depending on how that move goes, they can decide if that is a good decision for themselves.

        "comment": "I got started on Coinbase and only invested a little here and there in the big 3, and what may have been the most valuable lesson was that I bough in about two days before the big China crackdown.  I was in the red for all 3 (BTC/LTC/ETH) for over a month, and I was ready to kill my friends who got me interested in crypto.  But then I saw the coins climbing back and for whatever reason, I bought more.  It was not until early November that I made a Binance account and I got into Iota (based on a conversation I had with a guy at the gym sitting in the sauna lol).  I bought some Monero and Dash and that really opened my eyes.\n\nFast forward a bit and I dumped my dash, and I am now really high on REQ, IOTA, XRB, and NEO as solid projects with pretty bright futures, but by far I am most excited for VEN.  VEN looks just fantastic and is my largest holding right now.  I have also gotten my toes wet with some super small cap coins like WABI and WTC, and I might pick up some PRL.\n\nI am no expert and the market has treated me well, but I would say that a good mix of positions is a smart play.  Small market cap coins have the highest upside.  BTC is at ~300 billion market cap, so for it to double again would represent another 300 billion dollars being represented by BTC.  With smaller coins like WABI, we are only talking about another 500 million being represented for it to go 3.5x its current price.  Those are where to make your money and shotgunning small coins and hoping some will take off is a good way to catch massive gainers.\n\nIf you put $100 into ten small coins and 2 completely crash, 7 stay totally stagnant, and one goes 20x, you will be significantly up from where you started, and that is a very conservative estimation looking at where even big coins were a year ago.\n\nHappy hunting!",

        "comment": "Are you a beginner in #crypto? Do you want to invest a few bucks?\n\nThere is a bit too much nonsense floating about... Please be careful:\n\n1. Do not ever take the advice of anyone promoting a single coin. That includes Bitcoin. You need a portfolio. Yes, you can start a portfolio with a single US dollar.\n\n2. Decide on a portfolio. Use at least 3 coins. Make sure that they have been in existence for several years. Check this on http://coinmarketcap.com Don't fall for the hype of a coin no one has heard about.\n\n* Example of a pretty safe portfolio: BTC, LTC, DOGE.\n\n* Example of a non-portfolio: BTC\n\n* Example of a very unsafe portfolio: DOGE, SMLY\n\n3. Decide on the fraction you want of each coin. Unless you know better, just choose to always own roughly the same USD value in each. So with a 4 - coin portfolio you decide each is to be 25% of the portfolio (unless you know better).\n\n4. Find an exchange. Buy a little of each, eg $10 of each coin.\n\n5. Decide whether to keep the coins at the exchange (not very secure) or in a multicoin wallet such as @CoinomiWallet or ...\n\n6. On a regular basis check the relative values in your portfolio.\n\nYes, you can just leave it the way it is and if you've chosen reasonably, you'll do reasonably. If you've chosen silly hyped-up coins you will lose your money no matter what. If you've chosen highly variable coins (e.g. low-volume) then the value of your portfolio will jump all over the place.\n\nIf one coin drops a lot, or one increases a lot, you can exchange some of the highest valued one for the lowest. The golden rule: **Buy low, sell high**. \n\nRemember: **DO NOT BUY MORE OF THE COIN INCREASING IN VALUE**\n\nBe a little careful when you want to buy coins. Buying costs you money. You don't want to buy if the price changes 1%. You should probably sell a little if your coin increases 20%, possibly sell 10% and buy into a lower-valued part of the portfolio.\n\n**Caveat**: I like the **Smileycoin**. This is not an ad for SMLY: The Smileycoin is highly uncertain so please don't put all your money into it. The same applies to each cryptocurrency: Don't put all your eggs into one basket and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n",

You need to recognize BTC as a valid currency- equally important as USD, and if you want to eventually see BTC become just as utilizable as USD, understand that having less than what you started with is consequentially a loss.\n\nHopefully I helped in some way!

The main difference is probably that I view the separation of money and state as worthwhile. I kind of agree with you re: BTC. The fact that it isn't being used for transactions and is consuming so much energy strikes me as wasteful. If it was useful as a payment network, I think the power consumption would be better justified. Antonopoulos's response to the energy arguments was very hand-wavy to me. \n\nIn its original form, PoW was equalizing (you didn't need an initial buy in to start; you can just mine on your CPU/GPU while you sleep). But as it exists now, it has a lot of the same problems as PoS and is horribly unsustainable. ASICs could theoretically help as they are more efficient, but modest ROI hobby ASICs aren't really a thing. The closest I can think of is the Baikal Mini multi-algorithm optimized ASICS.  ",

My apologies if my shit doesn't look right.\n\nIf you think in USD instead of BTC (or any other coin you use to trade with), you run the risk of losing value when you buy/sell.\n\nFor example: \n\nLet's first assign BTC a value of 10k USD for quikmathz. Say you bought examplecoin at price of 0.05btc (which would be a price of 500 USD per coin). You're happy with this price and you plan to sell this coin when it reaches $750.\n\nLet's say you waited a few weeks, markets did their thing for a while, and now your examplecoin is valued at $750! Great, right? But what if during that stretch of time BTC also climbed to 20k. \n\nSo now in reality, your examplecoin is worth only 0.0375 BTC. If you sold that coin thinking you made a \"profit,\" you would be absolutely incorrect. If you sold that coin, you literally threw away 0.0125 BTC, or $250.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

ICX holds steady at 50k satoshis, or even goes up to say 65k satoshis. Based on what you are saying, it doesn't matter because \"hey look, you still have 65k satoshis worth of BTC you actually made a profit\". But if Bitcoin is now worth $3000 vs the pre-crash $13000, my 65k satoshis are only worth $1.95 vs the $6.5 the were worth before. Even though I made a \"satoshi profit\".\n\nMeasuring my trading in satoshis was absolutely worthless to me because I don't care about having more of a less valuable asset. In this situation even though ICX was \"going up\" I would have been better off selling ICX, and converting the BTC into fiat asap. Not rejoicing in \"satoshi gains\". \n\nThere should only be one consideration that needs to be made. It's called opportunity cost. If you are trading a pair like ICX/BTC, would you have otherwise invested your money into BTC? If yes, you only consider satoshi. That way you can know if it was better to have your money in ICX vs BTC. Because in either case you would not have been in fiat, and so you only want to measure the most profitable asset between BTC and ICX regardless of their fiat values.\n\nIf, however, you have no interest in holding BTC and you are forced to trade ICX in a crypto pairing because it has no fiat pairing, then satoshis mean fuck all. The only thing you care about is the $ value. ",

So likely most will fade away as teams with better visions and budgets come in.\n\nI read all of these whitepapers looking for something that seems solid, and just keep seem trash on trash on trash but still 500m to 1b evaluations. Some of them have bigger market caps than the industries they are looking to supplement. \n\nI think there will need to be an altcoin crash to wipe out the hundreds of shitcoins. Maybe 5-6 will come out the other side as leaders, and then hopefully more serious dev teams will come in scoop up the findings and fill the market place gap.\n\nOr you could maybe argue these are Gen 2 coins, and the first time BTC crashed, those were the Gen 1 coins. \n\nEither way I think it will take 3 crashes until we have coins that will see large scale adoption. \n\n",

        "comment": "No, not necessarily. High fees are mostly seen in Proof of Work systems like BTC and ETH (ETH will move over to PoS shortly, but still). In PoW systems miners basically have to be rewarded for \"unlocking\" coins and \"confirming\" transactions  (simplistically put). This is why they're energy inefficient  (BTC mining uses more power now annually than the entire country of the Netherlands -17 million souls- does) and expensive in transaction fees.\n\nIn Proof of Stake mechanisms there is no need for mining. Coins holders stake their coins instead. Way less energy consuming  (negligible) and cheap transactions. The stakers do still need to get rewarded for staking their coins though, so there will always be some fees.\n\nNow NEO uses an entirely different mechanism to ensure fast and low cost transactions. The network runs on bookkeeper nodes (let's say servers). These bookkeepers are holders of the NEO token and get voted in by other NEO holders. For running a node they receive a small fee per transaction. However, they can't charge too much, otherwise the NEO community will just vote in another bookkeeper who is willing to run the node for lower fees! This is called decentralization through coopetition.\n\nThe above is just an example. There are many varieties. Almost as many varieties as there are cryptos I would Imagine (I just happen to know the mechanisms of NEO best).\n\nHope this helped. ",

It's happened in China and Korea, it's inevitable this will happen in the US and will be something not unlike 'black friday' in the poker world. Expect 50% of the market to be wiped off within days.\n\n2) An exchange goes bust. Someone like Coinbase who are already having issues of month long delayed withdrawals is found to be a ponzi scheme or fractional reserve banking and cannot pay out its users. Expect 20-40% to be wiped off the market within days.\n\n3) New money stops coming in. Unlikely, but if new money stops coming in then prices stagnate or dip, people panic and sell off thereby reducing total market cap by 10-20% over a few weeks.\n\n4) Tax intervention for US/European citizens. Something is announced around new tax regulations effective 1st day of the new tax year 2019 which triggers a big sell off to take advantage of tax regulations.\n\n5) BTC goes balls up. While BTC is the most well known crypto its price reflects on the market. If BTC tanks then people are likely to pull money out citing a possible downturn in the market. \n\nInvest wisely, withdraw profits and be prepared to lose it all. ",

ETH, BTC and LTC are all past the point of regular people feeling like they can get into the game. \n\nIt is an optics thing, buying 500 xlm with fiat you can use to get other things will be more fun that .25352 of an ETH. \n\nI will have to read up more on it but the direct competition thing is the most attractive part.

My plan is to basically hold about 1/4 in ETH, 1/8 in BTC, and the rest spread between 3 medium caps and 5 smallcaps that could explode or die. I figured IOTA, ICX, XRB would be good mediums and better to try a couple like ENJ/LEND, but I've changed my thinking on how far VEN can go (I originally thought a marketcap of $3bn would be pushing it for what it offered).",

You are assuming that your \"base pairing\" of choice can't crash by 99%. (You don't even seem to assume it could crash by 75%)\n\nOP is right. What matters is fiat *and* the crypto pairing both.\n\nIt's even simple mathematics. A pairing has to variables *X* / *Y*. It's a 2-dimensional euclidean space which has two degrees of freedom. You need a second vector to span the entire space.\n\nYou are just assuming that one dimension is set.\n\nWhich is an easy mistake to make. Ethereum had very small but very steady gains since Christmas. There have not been many red days.\n\nYour argument is ideologic. You are not valuing things in fiat. You are valuing them in BTC. Which is commendable but essentially meaningless, were the entire market to crash and never recover. (Which is a possibility, if you deny this you have no leg to stand on)\n\nIt's OK not to believe in a crash. But you are preaching something of belief here.",

If the product dies, it will only take one motivated guy to make it live again and the benefits are too significant to see it disappear forever. \n\nIf his point had been that BTC would not fail (as in, drop to 0 value) because of how useful the blockchain is, then I would have agreed with you. But the point was that **cryptos** will not fail. BTC might be replaced by a more scalable coin, but the fact that we now know how to establish trust between independent actors of a flat network without central authority is there to stay, and that's what crypto is all about. \n\nDon't reduce crypto to its market, it's a much broader game than just about making money.

I don’t think that they are necessarily Battling each other to be the “True Bitcoin”, I see BTC as being more of a long term value storage and BCH being more transactional. It has faster transactions and lower transaction fees than BTC. \n\nLTC is so quick. If you want to get someone into cryptos, send them some LTC or XLM. They are super fast, having someone wait 10-20 minutes to confirm a transaction can really take the air out of their sails. It takes about a quarter of the time to generate a LTC block as it does one for BTC.\n\nAlso, both LTC and BCH are listed on Coinbase which is the most user friendly (although not fee friendly) way to purchase cryptos. Investors who are intimidated exchanges and intimidated by investing in lesser known alt coins will just diversify their crypto portfolio using the options available in Coinbase.\n\nThose are my bullish pros on the coins but I’m definitely open to hearing the other side as well. Hell, I welcome the Cons - helps me know what to look out for in this crazy, sick game of cryptos.",

I'm long on IOTA for example because I think there's a likelihood it will yield a higher return in satoshis than if I kept that amount in BTC for that time period. If not, I have a bunch of IOTA that may have value in its own right if the project is realized to its potential. So that's the type of asset I determine to be \"low-risk\" (relatively lol) because I don't just see it as a vehicle to accumulate. For other alts, I just see them as generic altcoins denominated in satoshis. Hard to be specific when most of this is contingent on your subjective opinions and goals.",

I don't give a fuck about the price of BTC apart from what it values my altcoins at. I'm up. \n\nNow, I HAVE actually grown my BTC considerably since my first purchase (well, ETH, as I bought in with that) but that's besides the point. For a while when I was holding only IOTA, I would have made more money if I had just held the ETH I bought originally.\n\nBut that didn't matter to me. I didn't buy ETH by choice - it was an intermediary to IOTA. Had I been able to buy IOTA right with fiat, I would have. I simply used ETH as a middleman to move my fiat to IOTA. ETH's price at the time, and its price afterwards is irrelevant. It's no different than saying I lost money because I bought IOTA instead of ADA. Yes - that's true. But i didn't intend to buy ADA, just as I didn't intend to buy ETH. My plan was IOTA.",

Maybe BTC's flaws are fixed and it becomes useful, but I don't see it right now. People say \"digital gold\" but real gold doesn't require the resources that BTC requires just to exist. Is all of that power eaten up by mining really worth a store of value? Only when the store of value is rapidly appreciating imo. When that stops, I don't think BTC is very useful. \n\nSome of the alts have much more potential to be useful in 5 years than BTC. There are coins that can be an anonymous exchange of value, there are coins that can be a low cost exchange of value and there are coins that can execute code in a proveably secure and decentralized manner. All of those uses seem to have genuine value. I just don't see it for BTC anymore, but we'll see what happens in the next 5 years.\n\nTL;DR: I think ETH and some of the alts are much better long term investments.",

        "comment": "Would it make more sense if you swapped gwei for satoshis? No matter what, if you trade cryptocurrency, you are trading against the value of something. Alts trade against the value of their base which trade against fiat. But with accumulation, every gain you make on alts is then compounded in your base, which gains or loses against fiat. The fundamental wager is that the currency you accumulate will gain against fiat. \n\nKeep in mind that, like I made explicit in op, this is not a tactical plan to win on every trade. It is a strategy of compounded gains that add up in the long term to a better ROI than trading a multitude of indexes against fiat. My basic premise isnt even complex at all: accumulation ultimately compounds your gains. And of course there is an overall leap of faith here, which is that the base asset (for me it's BTC) will gain against fiat. If your base asset loses, you were spinning your wheels. \n\nSorry if i am just repeating myself but i want to emphasize my larger premise. I can tell you that before I discovered this method, not only was i terrified every day of losing everything, but i couldnt keep track of the conditions which led to losses because i didnt have a unified system. With this, i am much less stressed and i can keep track of my bottom line in a very direct way. I can direct all my energies on a single goal, and make positive trades in any type of market. Before this, if the market was bearish i was treading water at best.",

If I'm purchasing Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin simply to get it to an exchange to purchase more VEN, I really don't see why I need to be looking at the price of BTC/ETH compared to my VEN even though they are trading pairs. The price of BTC/ETH may go up or down depending on how long it takes to get to the exchange, but other than that I don't really care; I'm holding the base pair for less than an hour. If my goal was to accumulate more BTC, I definitely get it - but that's not what I'm doing. This could be a terrible way of looking at it, but in 2017 all my bills are paid in fiat. We'll see how that changes in 2018.",

I admit, when I started in early December, I got into LTC, it tripled, and I started hunting for the next \"sure bet.\" I failed to pull out and redirect to BTC or ETH and compounded my error by FOMOing further into LTC at its ATH. Now I see the LTC as healthy correction, but then it was all just \"losses.\"\n\nNow I still have a significant position on LTC but I've diverted funds into BTC as well as some other large-mid cap coins. I know not to day-trade. But my question is this: do you smart investors swing trade often? I'm absorbing as much as I can about how to read tradingview charts and use the indicators, but I don't want to fall into the trap of doing 1 trade a day trying to predict things. How often are you guys trading? Or are you simply researching projects you believe in and investing and leaving it?\n\nThanks a lot.",

I want to sell my alt via BTC.. it doesn’t matter that btc tanked.. my value is still worth $20,000..\n\nI sell said alt for BTC... 10,000 coins valued at 2.00 a piece ($20,000) to bitcoin at 5,000 a piece = 4 BTC\n\nI then sell for USD.. 4BTC x $5,000 = $20,000\n\nAm I missing something...\n\n———\nNow let’s say the inverse happens.. \n\nI buy a bitcoin for 10k.. use the bitcoin to buy 10,000 Altcoin.\n\nAlt coin halves to $0.50 ($5,000) and bitcoin doubles to 20k\n\nI wanna cut my losses so I sell alt/btc which yields me \n.25 bitcoin.\n\nThis still yields me my $5,000.. \n\n\n\nEven if in scenario one my Altcoin doubled and bitcoin doubled and I sold my alt... it would still yield me the $20,000 that my Altcoin grew to....\n\nWhat am I missing?",

But that it true if the new money went straight to alts they would be more likely to just flee the market entirely, it's just new ground (alts have never been so much of the market).",

There's no way to gain that 0.0125 BTC you supposedly 'threw away' if you're planning on cashing out.  If you cash out directly to fiat, you 'threw it away'.  If you cash out to BTC, you still 'threw it away'.  Your only option is to HOLD until your 0.0375 BTC is worth 0.05BTC or more again and THEN transfer it to BTC as profit.  If that the goal?  So what this comes down to is that the goal with alts is to hopefully rapidly increase their value relative to BTC/ETH and then absorb profits to either BTC or ETH or whatever you believe is your main anchor?  Also, does any of this even make a difference if my plan is to just  HOLD HOLD HOLD my alts?  ",

        "comment": "Remember that there is little alt/fiat trading options. 95% of alt trading is done with ETH, BTC, LTC. So when a market dip is happening and people are panicking, everyone first cashes their alts out for ETH. Then they have to send that ETH to something like GDAX or Gemini, which doesn't happen instantly. A lot of time these exchanges get overloaded during panic sells and the order can take forever. So it feels like in general that the price of alts will always fall a lot faster, whereas ETH/BTC can get hung up in transfers. They also have a substantially larger market cap than most alts, which means it is more difficult to influence the price.",

        "comment": "Coinbase - you can invest in either Bitcoin, BitcoinCash, Ethereum or Litecoin\nGDax - essentially a subsidiary of Coinbase where you can transfer Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin without a fee. This will allow you to then move funds to the exchanges which will then allow you to trade altcoins.  Ethereum will transfer faster to the exchanges.  Binance, Cryptopia, Kucoin, Gate.io, CoinExchange.io are the common exchanges currently accepting new customers\n\nCoinMarketCap - website that shows you trends and available exchanges for all coins.  You can see which exchanges have specific coins available for trading and whether they can be traded using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc\n\nCoinStats - an app where you can track your investments and there progress.  I'm sure there are others but this one has worked well for me\n\nThe above should get you started.  Simplified, you deposit into Coinbase, transfer to GDax using the GDax website and then transfer from GDax to an exchange using a coin specific address.  The last part is very important...you can only send BTC to a Bitcoin address so please triple check that you are sending the correct coin to an address designated for that coin.  If you send BTC to an ETH address you may lose all funds.  You should probably practice with smaller transactions as you begin to invest and do multiple transactions to ensure you do not lose large sums of money.  \n\nThis subreddit and /r/altcoin are helpful for the coins aside from the big 4.  If you want free coins you need to be on the lookout for ICOs.  \n\nGood luck",

I thought this would be good for alts too, since alt USD value also goes up at the same time?\n\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, people who say you should always think in 'sats,' for example, believe that because you don't want to lose sats/usd? But i've seen plenty of alts over the last couple of weeks go 5x and 10x while BTC has remained relatively stable. So how does that work?\n\n\nIn other words, it's still better to sometimes hold alts as alts and not keep converting back to BTC, especially if those alts go up 500% over the next month, and BTC only goes up 20%... right?",

And if BTC has been worth $15k for that entire week, you're up.\n\n\nNow, lets say at the end of the week you sell the entire amount, and you have 10,000 sats now.

This advice was perfectly right for a long time, but it was in large part due to BTC being the only trading pair. 2017 changed everything and BTC has lost that power very much to ETH. It is always incredibly slow to transfer between exchanges and wallets and the fees are painful. Additionally, BTC no longer has such an enormous portion of the crypto market and it may very well get passed in the next few months in market cap. Bitcoin and alts are fairly decoupled already and in not very much time it really won't matter what Bitcoin does because alts won't be impacted. \n\nDon't buy the BTC dip anymore. You're just going to lose money. Buy the crypto dip, but not the BTC dip. ",
